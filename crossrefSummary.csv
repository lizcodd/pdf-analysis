Both of the given species was found to be hermaphrodite broadcast spawners annually. The gonads of P. verrucosa were found on stalks arising from the column wall; but in A. hemperchii, the gonads fill the entire mesenteries. Moreover, there are pronounced differences in the timing and length of gametogenesis and spawning of A. hemperchii and P. verrucosa between different geographic regions. A. hemperchii showed the least productivity at the effected with oil pollution at site 1, represented by: 55 % of mature oocytes and an additional 38 % of immature oocytes. P. verrucosa declined to 46 %of mature oocytes and 50% of immature oocytes. The highest productivity of A. hemperchii was represented by 90% matures,3 % immatures and 7% empty and for Pocillopora verrucosa increased to 92% matures, 2% immature, and 5 % empty at the offshore site 2, the site impacted by eutrophication as a result of phosphate shipment. The spawning season of A. hemperchii in the northern Red Sea at site 1, is two months later than in the southern site 2, where A. hemperchii starts spawning in May and extended to July. However, P. verrucosa begins one month early than A. hemperchii at the same site, and extends for three months also from April to June. Moreover, spawning of P. verrucosa at site 2 is one month early than at its spawning at site 1. While, P. verrucosa at sites 3&4 starts spawning at April and extended for two months only.",en

Here, we document the reproductive condition of corals Acropora in early June 2014 in Dahab, in the Gulf of Aqaba, 125 km south of previous studies conducted in Eilat, Israel. Seventy-eight percent of Acropora colonies from 14 species had mature eggs, indicating that most colonies will spawn on or around the June full moon, with a very high probability of multi-species synchronous spawning. Given the proximity to Eilat, we predict that a comparable sampling protocol would detect similar levels of reproductive synchrony throughout the Gulf of Aqaba consistent with the hypothesis that high levels of spawning synchrony are a feature of all speciose coral assemblages.",en

On September 13, 2012, a honeycomb cowfish (Acanthostracion polygonius) was observed creating annular lesions on A. palmata colonies at Molasses Reef in the Florida Keys (Fig. 1; video in Electronic Supplemental Material). A. polygonius typically preys on tunicates, alcyonarians, sponges, small crustaceans and gastropods (Randall 1967), and is not known to be a corallivore (Cole et al. 2008). To our knowledge, this is the first report of this species creating lesions on A. palmata. Lesions created by A. polygonius are distinct from other known fish bites (Bruckner 2007). They appear as a white ring with apparently healthy, intact tissue in the center, and are approximately 2 cm in diameter (Fig. 2). The ring appearance results from partial removal of tissue from the sides of the corallites and coenosteum, leaving polyps within the ring intact. There is no apparent mechanical damage to the corallites. As healing progresses, the ring gradually becomes a ring of pale tissue until zooxanthellae are recovered. Lesions heal rapidly (less than 6 weeks) and do not contribute to significant losses of live tissue. It is uncertain whether the fish is actively feeding on the coral tissue or the lesion is a by-product of the fish's foraging behavior. Although these lesions are rare, affecting 6 ± 4 % (mean ± SD) of colonies in the Florida Keys, their occurrence is typically clustered, affecting nearly 100 % of colonies at some sites. Of our 24 monitoring sites in Florida, colonies are consistently affected at three sites, while rings were rare to absent at the remaining sites.",en

We report here on population dynamics of the common reefbuilding coral Acropora hemprichi on a fringing reef slope in the northern Red Sea. Fusion, fission, and partial mortality of colonies were rare in this population. Analysis of population size structure and colony growth and mortality rates revealed a maximum colony age of 13 to 24 yr and rapid population turnover of 10 to 20 yr. A deficiency of juveniles resulted in older, larger, and less abundant coral colonies than expected for a population with stable age structure. Colonies of this major reefbuilder appeared to be aging without sufficient replacement, leading to a decline in abundance. Several processes may have contributed to the patterns observed, including variable recruitment over space and time, long-term recruitment failure, and/or low adult mortality. Total percent cover, which was determined mainly by large colonies, was little affected by the paucity of juveniles. We conclude that monitoring of live coral percent cover, even at high taxonomic resolution, cannot detect rapid change in coral assemblages, because it is not sensitive to variation in juvenile abundance and population dynamics. More extensive information on demographic processes, especially species-specific coral recruitment, is urgently needed for the effective and timely management of coral reefs.",en

Results indicated that both investigated species are hermaphroditic broadcasting spawner (release buoyant egg-sperm bundles) and showed gradual gonads maturity development begin from October until their spawning time in late April. All polyps became empty from egg sperm bundles in early May. There was a clear relationship between the spawning time of the two coral species and the lunar cycle, temperature, and photoperiod. Spawning of study species occurred on nights (nearly 3-4 hours after sunset) during the new moon and full moon phases.

(2006) has provided a comprehensive characterization of the population status of threatened elkhorn coral Acropora palmata stands around St. John, US Virgin Islands. These data on patterns of colony abundance, size structure, and threats contribute to understanding species status, and for planning possible proactive recovery actions. Similar studies are needed throughout the species' range. However, we have concerns regarding the interpretation of the survey results by Grober-Dunsmore et al. (2006), specifically in inferring higher levels of sexual (than asexual) recruitment in the populations surveyed. They base this inference on change in size structure of the population, and the visual appearance of individual colonies. Moreover, Grober-Dunsmore et al. (2006, p. 128) state that 'Acropora palmata populations around the island of St. John show signs of recovery, as evidenced by the significant increase in total abundance of colonies and abundance of new recruits from 2001 to 2003'. Population recovery for a clonal species cannot be inferred from surveys of colony abundance and size structure, because a population of few large colonies can suffer high rates of partial mortality, and thus result in the same local population (i.e. in terms of genotype richness) consisting of a much larger number of small colonies. More large and small colonies are necessary, but not sufficient, to achieve population recovery for a clonal species such as Acropora palmata, as genotypic diversity must be considered and the actual recruitment of new colonies (be they sexual or asexual) must be documented and distinguished from remnant colonies.

An increase in one or more of these attributes generally indicates a trajectory toward demographic recovery (Hughes & Tanner 2000). Numerous field studies (e.g. Jordan-Dahlgren 1992, Edmunds & Carpenter 2001, Rogers et al. 2003, Grober-Dunsmore et al. 2006) have used demographic measures as indicators of potential recovery of Caribbean Acropora palmata populations from the mass mortality of the 1980s, in part because these measures are cost-effective, easy to sample, informative, and comparable to historical data. For example, long-term studies of quadrats in Jamaica documented loss of corals, followed by recent increases in recruits and coral cover (creating 3D structure) (Woodley 1999, Woodley et al. 1999, Edmunds & Carpenter 2001). These measures were related to changes in the environment, e.g. densities of echinoid grazers, and used as indicators of the recovery trajectory of the coral communities. Miller et al. (2007, this volume) have critiqued this approach, suggesting that demographic measures are necessary, but not sufficient to assess recovery of clonal invertebrates; they argue that some measure of genetic diversity is 'quintessential'.

Artificial lesions (colony surface wounds) were made on 3 randomly selected branches of 21 colonies and regeneration was followed over 30 d. Regeneration was measured as tissue regrowth (mm2 d-') durlng the first 6 d of regeneration and as the slope of an exponential regression of lesion surface area through time. Both measurements showed that regenerative potential could be fitted to an exponential function, decreasing from tip to base. Regeneration capability decreases rapidly in the first 25 cm from the distal end and only slowly beyond. This decrease in regeneration capability appears to be related to polyp age and constitutes the first report of potent~al senescence in corals.

Invasion of lesions by excavating sponges will occur more In proximal portions of the colony because the slow regeneration potential in this area results in long-term skeletal exposure. This may promote the fragmentation of branches with a length sufficient to ensure a high survivorship KEY WORDS: Regenerdtion. Modular organisms Corals. Ecology. Damage. Age Senescence. Growth.
