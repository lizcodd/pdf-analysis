Polymorphisms of TGFB1 gene have been associated to TGFB1 altered expression, disease susceptibility and prognosis. The present study evaluated polymorphisms of the TGFB1 promoter region and plasma levels of TGFB1 in 104 ALL patients and 115 controls. Furthermore, it was investigated its possible involvement in different clinical stages of ALL. Both polymorphisms were not associated with ALL susceptibility or risk of relapse and their different genotypes did not alter TGFB1 plasma levels. However, it was verified decreased of TGFB1 concentration in ALL compared to control group (p<0.0001). TGFB1 plasma levels were significantly lower in ALL patients at diagnosis comparing to treatment (p=0.004) and remission (p<0.0001) groups. Notably, patients in remission presented similar TGFB1 plasma levels to controls. This work demonstrated the effects of a deregulated immune function in childhood ALL concerning to TGFB1 regarding prognosis and suggests TGFB1 recovery induced by treatment.",en

While coral reefs have many ecological and economic functions, the condition keeps declining due to many factors. One of the efforts made to improve the condition is transplantation activities. We transplanted two species of Acropora, namely A. divaricata and A. nobilis using the PVC rack method in water depths of 5, 10 and 15 m. This study was conducted from January to October 2018. The growth rate and zooxanthellae densities from each depth were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's studentized rang statistical analysis (HSD) to determine the best treatment. The growth of both species showed significant differences (P < 0.05). The highest growth rates of A. divaricata and A. nobilis were obtained at 5 m depth of 0.539±0.7 and 0.500±0.16 (mean±SD) cm month-1 , and the lowest growth at 15 m depth was 0.21 ±0.02 and 0.162±0.14 (mean±SD) cm month-1. Zooxanthellae density also showed differences at each depth. The highest zooxanthellae density of A. divaricata and A. nobilis at 5 m depth was 1.372±0.25 x 10 6 (mean±SD) cells cm-2 and 0.603±0.455 x 10 6 (mean±SD) cells cm-2 , respectively. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the correlation between growth and zooxanthellae densities on A. divaricata was highly significant (r 2 = 0.331 and p< 0.01). Meanwhile, it was not significant at A. nobilis (r 2 = 0.011 and p > 0.05). The highest growth rate and zooxanthellae densities were found at a lower depth and decreased with the increasing depth. The correlation between growth rate and zooxanthellae densities is positive, despite different values according to species.",en

The aim of this study was to investigate the bioerosion by microflora of a scleractinian finger coral Acropora humilis, which collected from the reef edge of El Ain El Sukhna (Gulf of Suez-Red Sea) by using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The collected colonies of A. humilis were solid, very porous, and branching. These colonies have two colors; brown color with purple branch tips and yellow color with cream branch tips. Individual branches form fat fingers; 10 to 25 mm in diameter and less than 200 mm in length, tapering to large domeshaped axial corallites. Small branchlets or incipient axial corallites usually occur at the base of main branches. Radial corallites are cup-shaped and have two sizes, the larger are usually in rows and have thick walls and only slightly increase in size down the sides of branches. Axial and radial corallites have a series of vertical rods arranged in concentric rings and horizontal radial and tangential bars. The radial bars form the sclerosepta along with the vertical rods. The tangential bars are synapticulae that connect adjacent sclerosepta to one another. Series of fasciculi form the characteristic scale-like appearance of A. humilis skeleton. The bioerosion was investigated at least in one branch of some colonies which were harbored by fungi, green algae and cyanobacteria; led to loss of tissues and erosion of rods, bars and fusiform crystals. Acropora humilis is subjected to bioerosion due to: its surface which covered by muco-polysaccharides, its high porosity and its branching form; whose facilitate colonization by boring organisms.",en

Tolerance to heat and cold exposure has been found to be mutually exclusive in other marine invertebrates, but it is currently unclear whether a trade-off exists between hot and cold thermal tolerance in tropical corals. This study quantified the changes in physiology in Acropora millepora from the central Great Barrier Reef subjected to three temperature treatments; sub-lethal cold, ambient and sublethal heat (23.0°C, 27.0°C and 29.5°C, respectively). After 10 weeks, pigment content and Symbiodiniaceae density increased in cold-treated corals but decreased in heat-treated corals relative to corals at ambient conditions. Heat-treated corals gained less mass relative to both ambient and cold-treated corals. These results indicate that the physiological condition of A. millepora corals examined here improved in response to mild cold exposure compared to ambient exposure and decreased under mild heat exposure despite both these temperatures occurring in situ around 15% of the year. The energetic condition of corals in the hotter treatment was reduced compared to both ambient and cooler groups, indicating that corals may be more resilient to mild cold exposure relative to mild heat exposure. The results indicate that the corals shifted their resource allocation in response to temperature treatment, investing more energy into skeletal extension rather than maintenance. No evidence of thermal tolerance tradeoffs was found, and cold thermal tolerance was not lost in more heat-tolerant individuals. An enhanced understanding of physiological responses of corals at both ends of the thermal spectrum is important for predicting the resilience of corals under projected climate change conditions.",en

This may imply that evolutionary expansion of the TRAF protein repertoire occurred after the phyla's divergence in evolutionary time o P. damicornis's large and diverse number of TRAF proteins may be suggestive of its ability to better handle and manage stressful condition. A closer regulation of inflammation and apoptosis may to prevent unnecessary tissue damage and cell death in the host (Yang et al., 2015). o Previous coral immunological studies involving the increase expression of NOD-like receptors, AP-1 transcription factors, and TNFR during stress exposure may have implications on how TRAFs are involved in the process of coral general stress response and coral bleaching (Traylor-Knowles et al. 2017; Zhou et al 2017) Conclusion and Future Directions o This study of the TRAF repertoire in Pocillopora damicornis can serve as a starting point in the investigation into the importance of TRAF proteins in coral immunology.

These programs have proven to be effective at increasing the abundance of local populations of Acropora cervicornis where outplanting is conducted. Typical monitoring of outplanted corals normally focuses on individual colonies. Frequently, monitoring at the level of an individual colony becomes more complicated after 1-2 years as corals grow and intertwine, new colonies are created through fragmentation, tags become hard to relocate as they are overgrown, etc. Longer-term monitoring goals (3-5 years) should look at a broader scale that considers the health of thickets created by outplanting, coral and thicket size (expansion or reduction), asexual recruitment, and changes in the structure and health of the whole reef community. Photomosaics are a useful tool for this type of community monitoring. The research presented here used photomosaics collected annually and analyzed with Coral Point Count with Excel Extensions (CPCE) to monitor the growth and expansion of thickets that were outplanted at 2 grounding sites in Puerto Rico, USA.. Using photomosaics, significant increases in coral cover by A. cervicornis and significant decreases in the presence of bare substrate were recorded.

This genetic connection has not been tested, and it requires re-evaluation because spawning patterns of Western Australian corals are not as synchronous or seasonal as originally thought. Here, we used population genetics to examine patterns of gene flow among populations of the scleractinian coral Acropora tenuis in Indonesia and Western Australia. Analysis of microsatellite data showed that Indonesian and Australian populations are highly genetically differentiated. Importantly, this genetic divergence is associated with differences in the seasonal spawning time of A. tenuis between the two regions, with Indonesian populations dominated by 'spring' spawners and Western Australian populations dominated by 'autumn' spawners, indicating that spawning season has an important influence on genetic structure. Furthermore, negligible gene flow between Indonesia and Western Australia indicates that the recolonization of inshore Western Australian populations since the Last Glacial Maximum was independent of input from Indonesian populations.",en

Nutrient enrichment can amplify the negative effects of predation on corals by facilitating dysbiosis in the coral microbiome that leads to coral mortality. These patterns suggest that nutrient pollution might suppress the capacity of the coral immune system to respond to microbial infections that follow mechanical injury from predation. Here, we measured the impact of nutrient enrichment and predation on tyrosinase-type and laccase-type phenoloxidase (PO) activities, which are key components of immune defense pathway involved in melanin synthesis and wound healing in corals. Corals were exposed in situ to either ambient or enriched nutrient levels in combination with either no damage, mechanical damage, or predation damage from parrotfishes. The activity of PO enzymes in response to both tyrosinase-type substrates significantly decreased under nutrient enrichment, suggesting that corals became immune-compromised. Predation damage also increased laccase activity, implicating it in tissue repair and potentially defense from pathogens.

Unfortunately, the current understanding of the links between environmental signals, epigenetic modifications, and the subsequent consequences for acclimatory phenotypic changes remain obscure. Such a knowledge gap extends also to the dynamic nature of epigenetic changes, hampering our ability to ascertain the magnitude and extent of these responses under natural conditions. The present work aims to shed light on these subjects by examining temporal changes in genomewide patterns of DNA methylation in the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis in the island of Culebra, PR. During a 17-month period, a total of 162 polymorphic loci were identified using Methylation-Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP). Among them, 83 of these restriction fragments displayed changes in DNA methylation that were significantly correlated to seasonal variation as determined mostly by changes in sea water temperature. Remarkably, the observed time-dependent variation in DNA methylation patterns is consistent across coral genets, coral source sites and sitespecific conditions studied. Overall, these results are consistent with a conserved epigenetic response to seasonal environmental variation. These findings highlight the importance of including seasonal variability into experimental designs investigating the role of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation in responses to stress.",en

Coral reefs are now in danger because the marine environment around them is degrading, causing corals to get ill more often. Scientists have used fragments of healthy coral colonies or planted baby corals to help restore reefs that are in bad shape. But for these e orts to succeed, it is vital for the scientists to select healthy corals for planting. Corals use a substance called melanin to trap bacteria that grows in their tissues. We discovered that the enzyme phenoloxidase, which is responsible for making melanin, can be found in the snotty covering of corals, called mucus. We can take samples of this mucus to measure phenoloxidase without harming the corals. By doing so, we can detect whether a coral colony is responding to the presence of harmful bacteria even before it shows any signs of illness.",en

This coral species was selected for parameterization due to its capacity to survive in wave/current exposed areas with moderate to high energy environments, where its branches and the global structure of its colonies play an important role for wave damping. Small scale experiments were carried out for two different flow regimes: steady and oscillatory flow. For this purpose, a current flume as well as a wave flume were used. In-line forces, flow velocities and water surface elevations over 3-D models of A. palmata were measured for two main configurations: a single coral and a group of corals. The results show that under steady flow conditions, the drag coefficient (CD) can be well represented as a function of the Reynolds number by means of a power law equation, = + (determination coefficient, R 2 >0.98). Also, under oscillatory flow conditions, for the studied rigid coral with flat branches, it is shown that the inertia force (FM) dominates over the drag component (FD), explaining up to 83% of the total force exerted on the coral structure.",en

Introgression and ancient large-scale/whole genome duplication (paleopolyploidy) have been hypothesized to promote on rapid speciation leading to diversification. In addition, diversification can be promoted by 'ecological opportunity' created by extinction of competitors or the colonization of a new area. Reef-building corals are the foundation of diverse tropical ecosystems, but are currently under threat due to the sensitivity of corals to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Acropora (Anthozoa: Acroporidae) is one of the most diverse genera of reef-building corals, including more than 150 species, and based on the fossil record has dominated Indo-Pacific reefs in past 3 Million Years, yet the evolutionary and ecological factors associated with its diversification and the rise to dominance are unclear. Understanding the evolutionary history of this group during its rise to dominance may help understanding their current and future responses to global change. In this dissertation, I used genomic data of Acropora generated by Dr. Chuya Shinzato to investigate its evolutionary history and illuminate the roles of introgression, largescale genome duplication, and ecological opportunity in its diversification and the rise to dominance. In the first chapter, I reviewed recent studies of Acropora. In the second chapter, I examined the roles of introgression in Acropora. I found that a major introgression event and widespread gene flow occurred in five Acropora species, and that introgression genes evolved faster than others. In the third chapter, I examined the roles of climate change in the rise to dominance of Acropora. I found that Acropora lineages had an experience of population expansion after a climatedriven mass extinction event in the Plio-Pleistocene, suggesting ecological opportunity facilitated the rise to dominance of Acropora. In the fourth chapter, I examined evidence for large-scale genome duplication and its consequences in Acropora. I found a large-scale genome duplication event likely occurred in Acropora and duplicated genes play important roles in the diversification of Acropora. Finally, in the fifth chapter, I discussed limitations and future directions arising from this dissertation. Collectively, this dissertation suggests that introgression, climate change, and large-scale genome duplication play important roles in the evolutionary history of Acropora.",en

The studied reefs were either cay-crowned or submerged and were divided over four shelf zones varying in distance offshore. The species are compared with regard to their distributions (1) across the shelf in four zones parallel to the coastline, (2) around the reefs with orientation according to wind directions, and (3) along depth gradients over the reef fl ats, slopes, and bases. Most species showed their highest abundances on wave-exposed mid-shelf reef slopes. Within transects, species showed overlapping depth ranges, visible as multi-species assemblages with average densities in quadrats of up to 25 m-2 composed of a maximum of 26 co-occurring species. Most species were concentrated on reef slopes, some mainly on shallow reef fl ats, and a few on deeper reef bases. Several species showed a downward shift in depth range with increasing distance offshore. A clustering of the reefs with respect to similarity in species composition appeared to be related to their distance offshore and to the presence or absence of shallow reef substrates important for recruitment.

m013p273,NA,MARINE ECOLOGY -PROGRESS SERIES,August 30,NA,"Samples of the scleractinian coral Agaricia agaricites (Limaeus) were studied for time of planula release, planula production and related characteristics. The corals were collected over a 2 yr period on the fringing reef of Curaqao at depths from 5 to 30 m. Two distinct reproductive pattems emerged. Based on these patterns and on consistent differences in skeletal morphology, such as size of calices and n b b e r of septa, the separation of the form A. agaricites humilis Vemll as a distinct species, A. hurnilis, from the other forms of A. agaricites is proposed. A. humilisplanulated throughout the year. A. agaricites shed planulae in spring and summer, a period of increasing sea water temperatures. In A, humilis 78 % of the colonies (N = 133) released planulae within 1 wk after collection, compared with only 26 % (N = 91) in A. agaricites. Maxlmum diameter of the smallest planulating colonies of A. humilis was about 4 times less (28 mm) than in A. agaricites (108 mm). Planula production per unit living tissue area was 4 times larger (0.86 planulae cm-2 wk-') in A. humilis than in A. agaricites (0.23 planulae cm-2 wk-l). However, planula volume was 5 times lower (0.166 mm3) than in A. agaricites (0.860 mm3). It appears that A. humilis employs an opportunistic reproductive strategy compared with A. agaricites. A. humilis is mainly confined to the shallow reef flat and drop off zone (5 to 12 m) and colony diameters rarely exceed 100 mm. A. agaricitesreaches its greatest abundance on the deeper reef slope (10 to 30 m), growing to a maximum size of 600 mm.

Steigende Temperaturen als Resultat des globalen Klimawandels und steigender Kohlendioxid Gehalt (CO 2) in der Atmosphäre haben den CO 2 Gehalt im Wasser ansteigen lassen und damit den pH Wert sinken lassen, was zum Anstieg von gelöstem inorganischem Kohlenstoff (DIC) und der sogenannten ""Ozeanversauerung"" (OA) führt und aquatische Organismen weltweit beeinflusst. Auf lokaler Ebene haben Bevölkerungswachstum und Küstenentwicklung zu einer Zunahme von inorganischen Nährstoffen im Wasser und zu einer Überdüngung geführt. Diese hat zu einer Zunahme von gelösten organischen Kohlenstoffen (DOC) im Wasser geführt, von denen bekannt ist, dass sie negative Einflüsse auf den Gesundheitszustand von Korallen haben. Erstaunlicher Weise ist wenig darüber bekannt wie hohe DIC und DOC Verfügbarkeit die Physiologie von Korallen und kalzifizierenden Algen beeinflussen und ob diese sich gegenseitig verstärken und eventuell die Funktionen der Riffe der Zukunft verändern. Diese Arbeit untersuchte daher die individuellen und kombinierten Effekte von DIC und DOC Verfügbarkeit auf die Physiologie von riffbildenden Korallen aus dem Großen Barriere Riff sowie von kalzifizierenden Algen aus dem Indo-Pazifik und der Karibik. Um einen übergreifenden Einblick in die Prozesse zu gewinnen, die möglicherweise beeinflusst werden, wurden Kalzifizierung, Photosynthese und Stickstofffixierung des Korallen Holobiont inklusive der assoziierten Bakterien und der kalzifizierenden Grünalgen untersucht. In einem einführenden Kapitel wird die Theorie hinter Ozeanversauerung sowie der Einfluss auf marine Lebensformen in den Tropen behandelt und eine Liste mit Indikator Prozessen vorgeschlagen (Kapitel 1). Die nächsten drei Kapitel behandeln die physiologischen Einflüsse von erhöhter DIC und DOC Verfügbarkeit und deren Interaktion auf Riffkorallen von dem Großen Barriere Riff sowie kalzifizierenden Grünalgen aus dem Indo-Pazifik und der Karibik (Kapitel 2 bis 4). Da das derzeitige Wissen über den Kalzifizierungsmechanismus der kalzifizierenden Grünalge Halimeda beschränkt ist, aber nötig ist um die physiologischen Einflüsse von OA und DOC zu verstehen, ist diese Arbeit um 2 Kapitel erweitert, die den geobiologischen Kalzifizierungsprozess von Halimeda opuntia behandeln und diesen Anhand von Raster Elektronenmikroskopie und bekannten physiologischen Prozessen aufklären (Kapitel 5). Erkenntnisse aus dieser Studie wurden dann auf die Kalzifizierung unter OA Bedingungen erweitert (Kapitel 7). Da Licht ein wichtiger Faktor ist, der Prozesse wie Photosynthese und Kalzifizierung in Algen und Korallen antreibt, wurde der individuelle und kombinierte Effekt von Licht und OA auf die Alge H. opuntia und Koralle Acropora millepora in einem zusätzlichen Kapitel untersucht (Kapitel 6). Um das Gesamtverständnis der physiologischen Veränderung von Korallen unter OA zu verbessern wurde zudem ein sehr wichtiger Teil des Nährstoffkreislaufes, der Stickstofffixierung der Koralle Seriatopora hystrix und erhöhten DIC Bedingungen untersucht (Kapitel 8). XVI Die Schlüsselfragen dieser Studie waren: 1) Wie beeinflussen erhöhte DIC und DOC Verfügbarkeit die Physiologie von wichtigen Kalzifizierern des Korallenriffes und interagieren diese beiden Stressoren? 2) Was sind die Haupt Charakteristiken der Kalzifizierung von H. opuntia? 3) Wie wird dieser Prozess von erhöhter DIC Verfügbarkeit beeinflusst? 4) Wie beeinflussen Licht und DIC die Kalzifizierung von wichtigen Riff Kalzifizierern? 5) Wie wird die Stickstofffixierung von Seriatopora hystrix durch erhöhte DIC Konzentrationen beeinflusst? Um diese Fragen zu beantworten wurden vergleichende Messungen der Physiologie dieser Organismen unter kontrollierten Umweltbedingungen durchgeführt und verschiedene Umweltbedingungen miteinander verglichen. Hierbei wurden physiologische Messungen zusammen mit der Analyse der Kalzifizierungsstruktur benutzt und ein neues Modell der Kalzifizierung von Halimeda zu erstellen und dieses um den Einfluss von hohen DIC zu erweitern. Haupterkenntnisse dieser Arbeit waren:-Erhöhte DIC Konzentrationen reduzieren das Wachstum und die Kalzifizierung unter Abwesenheit von Licht von A. millepora, reduzieren die Tageskalzifizierungsraten von H. opuntia, und reduzieren Tageskalzifizierungsraten sowie die Primärproduktion von Halimeda incrassata und Udothea flabellum. Zusätzlich wurden die Stickstofffixierungsraten von S. hystrix im Vergleich zu den Kotrollbedingungen reduziert, und zeigten signifikante Korrelationen mit den Kalzifizierungsraten.-Unter erhöhten DOC Konzentrationen wurden die Primärproduktion von H. macroloba, H. opuntia, A. millepora und H. incrassata reduziert. Das Wachstum und die Kalzifizierung von A. millepora und die Kalzifizierungsraten von H. incrassata und U. flabellum wurden ebenso reduziert.-Erhöhte DIC und DOC Verfügbarkeit führte zu additive Effekten auf die Physiologie von Korallen und Algen, zeigten aber auch interaktive Reaktionen unter dem Einfluss beider Stressoren die in Kombination einen höheren Einfluss auf die Organismen zeigten als im einzelnen indem z.B: die Kalzifizierungsraten von U. flabellum noch deutlicher reduziert wurden also von hohen DIC Konzentrationen alleine.-Die Kalzifizierungsstrukturen von H. opuntia ließen sich in drei Typen unterteilen und deren Formierung wurde auf zwei Hauptkomponenten aufgeteilt: Tages-und Nachtprozesse bei denen beide, abiotische sowie biotische Prozesse eine wichtige Rolle spielten. Unter dem Einfluss von hohen DIC Konzentrationen wurde vor allem die Zementierung der einzelnen Segmente von H. opuntia beeinflusst und unter diesen Bedingungen wurde diese Zementierung deutlich reduziert. Zusammenfassend konnten wir zeigen das erhöhte DIC Verfügbarkeit multiple Einflüsse auf die Physiologie von Riffalgen sowie Korallen hat welche zu reduzierten Primärproduktionsraten sowie niedrigen Kalzifizierungsraten kombiniert mit schwacher Zementierung führen. Diese Erkenntnisse XVII zeigen auf das die Produktivität der von kalzifizierenden Korallen und Algen dominierten Gemeinschaften unter zukünftigen OA Bedingungen drastisch sinken könnte. Nicht nur könnte die Netto Kalzifizierung dieser Gemeinschaften abnehmen, sondern, wie am Beispiel von Halimeda gezeigt, wird das gebildete Skelett schwächer und führt letztendlich zur einer reduzierten Widerstandsfähigkeit gegenüber biotischen und abiotischen Faktoren und schlussendlich zu erhöhten Erosionsraten und reduzierter Strukturkomplexität dieser wichtigen Bildner biogener Hartsubstrate. In dieser Arbeit konnten wir zeigen, dass die Physiologie von Riffkorallen und Algen durch hohe DIC und DOC Verfügbarkeit beeinflusst wird und das hohe DOC Konzentrationen negative Einflüsse auf die Physiologie (Wachstum, Photosyntheseleistung) dieser Schlüsselorganismen hat. Dies wird wahrscheinlich die Produktion von biogenen Karbonaten durch Algen und Korallen verringern was zu einem Verlust von struktureller Komplexität in den Riffen des Indo-Pazifik und der Karibik führen kann. Für die durch Halimeda Sande geprägten Ökosysteme bedeutet dies ein Verlust von wertvollem Habitat durch die verringerte Konkurrenzfähigkeit von Halimeda aufrgund reduzierten Wachstumes und geringerer physischer Stabilität durch schwächer kalzifizierte Skelette. Dies hat zudem negative Auswirkungen auf die Pufferkapazität dieser Ökosysteme gegenüber weiterer Versauerung, da die Halimeda Sande einen natürlichen Carbonat Puffer darstellen. Das von uns vorgestellte neue Modell zur Kalzifizierung von Halimeda wird wertvoll für zukünftige Studien sein, die den Einfaluss von Umweltfaktoren auf den Kalzifizierungsprozess dieser Alge untersuchen werden. Es kann zudem die Interpretation der kalzifizierten Struktur in lebendem um totem Material vereinfachen und Aussagen über die Diagenese zulassen. Diese Erkenntnisse können dazu beitragen Veränderungen in den Riffen der Zukunft und hohen DIC und DOC Gehalten zu untersuchen und vorherzusagen. Zudem können diese Erkenntnisse zu Kalzifizierungsraten sowie deren Kalzifizierungsstruktur also Indikatoren für wechselnde Umwelteinflüsse dienen und Vorhersagen über Karbonatproduktion ermöglichen.",de

All corals from the MPA started to bleach in the laboratory before they were exposed to the treatments, indicating that they were very sensitive, as opposed to the corals collected from the more polluted site, which were more tolerant and showed no bleaching response to temperature increase or herbicide alone. However, the combined exposure to the stressors resulted in significant loss of color, proportional to loss in chlorophyll a and zooxanthellae. The difference in sensitivity of the corals collected from the polluted site versus the MPA site could be explained by different symbiont types: the resilient type C3u and the stress-sensitive types C21 and C23, respectively. The additive effect of elevated temperatures and herbicides adds further weight to the notion that the bleaching of coral reefs is accelerated in the presence of multiple stressors. These results suggest that the corals in Nha Trang bay have adapted to the ongoing pollution to become more tolerant to anthropogenic stressors, and that multiple stressors hamper this resilience. The loss of color and decrease of chlorophyll a suggest that bleaching is related to concentration of chloro-pigments. The colorimetric method could be further fine-tuned and used as a precise, non-intrusive tool for monitoring coral bleaching in situ.",en

In order to know about their current status, ecological assessments were carried out in two contrasting systems: Isla Fuerte (Socorro) in Córdoba and Isla Aguja (Torín), Tayrona National Natural Park, department of Magdalena. Coral cover associated with colonies of A. palmata was quantified throughout 20 m transects, where visual censuses were made to evaluate the interactions with organisms such as snails, fishes, fireworms, among others. In addition, the degree of injuries in relation to the area that they occupy in the living tissue, and the health of colonies was studied. The coral coverage associated with A. palmata was 33.40% in Socorro, and 59.90% in Torin. The main interaction was the presence of Stegastes in both sites (approximately 2 ind. per colony), however other fishes such as Lactophrys and Microspathodon and the presence of fireworms Hermodice carunculata were also observed. Only sea urchins Diadema antillarum were found in Torín and snails Coralliophila erosa in Socorro. The Socorro presented a greater area of tissue with injuries, mainly by fumaroles and macroalgal, while Torín presented circular marks and disease injuries attributed to White pox and White band disease.

In summary, a matrix was formed by sampling from 6 horizontal legs in about 24 vertical transects. However, the plan was not practical for both national Parks, and the Parks were sampled separately. Therefore, the surface sediments (0-5 cm) from 134 stations were gathered using a Van Veen sampler. Taking the granulometric dilution effect into account, bulk sediments were sieved (mesh number 60) in laboratory and < 250 µm. The dried and size normalized sediments were homogenized prior to extraction. Then, the sediment samples (4 g) were spiked with 100 ng g−1 surrogate standards of naphthalene-d8, antherancene-d10, chrysene-d12 and perylene-d12. The sediments were extracted by a microwave sample extraction system (Ethos 1, Milestone, Italy). Microwave extraction was established at 150 °C for 20 min, using 30 mL of solvent mixture of n-hexane-acetone (1:1, v/v). After the extraction, the supernatant organic extract was carefully decanted from the extraction vessels and the samples were re-extracted by 10 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) for 7 min at 100 °C. Then, two extracts of each sample were combined together and the activated copper wires were added to remove the sulfur content from the extracts overnight. After these steps, all following procedures were carried out according to guidelines of MOOPAM (2000), recommended for the analysis of marine sediments. The analysis was performed with a Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) model 6890N GC system equipped with a 5973 mass detector. 3. Results and discussion Surface sediments (n =121) were gathered from nearly 1% of the Persian Gulf's basin to evaluate spatial pattern and source apportionment of ∑24n-alkanes and ∑16parent-PAHs. Levels of ∑24n-alkanes and ∑16parent-PAHs were in the range of 1.98-814 ng g-1 dw (mean= 174.31) and 2.29 to 206.59 µg g-1 dw (mean= 11.22), respectively. Therefore, the region was low to moderate polluted in general. To reveal spatial patterns of the deposited eco-pollutants, a combined GIS, geo-statistics and autocorrelation analyses were employed. In the case of PAHs, Global Moran's I index outlined the presence of significant ∑16PAHs clusters in the region (Moran's I index =0.62, Z-score =25.6). Anselin Moran's I index specified locations of the significant low or high spatial clusters where offshore of the Pars South Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) recognized as a High-High clustered area. The levels of random and structural variance of ∑16PAHs were about 0.083 and 0.154 ng, respectively. Nugget to sill ratio confirmed that ∑16PAHs have got a moderate level of spatial structure. Prediction and standard error maps of ∑16PAHs, produced by ordinary kriging, suggested that more samples should be taken from the high clustered region for upcoming studies. Fuzzy logic functions (OR and AND) were used to develop eco-risk maps. It made obvious that the potential hazards of PAHs were considerable at the vicinity of petrochemical facilities, i.e, the Nayband Marine National Park. Moran's I indices suggested that ∑24n-alkanes were randomly distributed in sampling space in general. One noticeable exception was a significant spatial High-High cluster (Z-score =8.6). Profile of n-alkanes observed for this cluster maximized at n-C20, n-C18, n-C16 and n-C22. Detection of very low Carbon Preference Indices and strong even Carbonnumbered predominance suggested that bacterial inputs were the process making this cluster. The data relevant to the 2 nd International Conference on Oceanography for West Asia 3 diagnostic ratios of deposited n-alkanes were used to make GIS-based layers. With combination of the mentioned layers in GIS environment, Source Apportionment Maps were produced for individual sources, including; Petrogenic Source Apportionment Map, Allochthonous Source Apportionment Map and, Autochthonous Source Apportionment Map. With reference to the maps, in-situ production of organic materials was widespread in the studied space and allochthonous and petroleum-based inputs were not traceable for 73.8% and 24.7% of the area, respectively. In addition, Petrogenic Source Apportionment Map proposed that petroleum-originated contaminants were probably limited to 6.32 km 2 of the sampling matrix. The biogenic inputs (autochthonous and allochthonous inputs) and not the petroleum contaminants were the main source of n-alkanes deposited in the studied zones.",en

With such temporally limited instrumental records, proxy-based reconstructions are an invaluable source of climate information. Current paleoclimate databases indicate a lack of records representing the southern hemisphere and tropics; key regions that can be represented by high resolution, coral geochemistry-based climate reconstructions. Reef coring techniques allow the recovery of significant proportions of coral material from throughout the Holocene, Pleistocene and beyond. Given the high species diversity of Indo-Pacific coral reefs, the presence of massive Porites commonly used for climate reconstruction is likely to be limited in reef cores. Corymbose Acropora, however, displays a high abundance in modern and fossil reef records and thus could act as a major source of new climate information from the Earth's recent history. Previous investigations of Acropora geochemistry have focused on branches, with significant levels of secondary thickening smoothing environmental signals otherwise recorded by the Sr/Ca ratio paleothermometer. This project investigates the potential of Acropora interbranch skeleton as a climate archive, following the identification of annual density banding patterns in computed tomography scans. Scanning electron microscopy based documentation of structure and growth patterns reveal that inter-branch skeleton is atypical for Acropora. Low linear extension rates, a simplified skeletal structure with limited secondary aragonite deposition, approximately horizontal density bands and seasonal cyclicity in Sr/Ca ratios bear a greater resemblance to massive corals such as Porites. These observations, combined with a high abundance in past and present Indo-Pacific reefs, suggest that inter-branch skeletal growth in Acropora may prove to be a valuable source of untapped paleoclimate information. A site-specific calibration for Acropora inter-branch skeleton Sr/Ca ratios to water temperature was conducted using modern corymbose Acropora colonies and concomitant instrumental water temperature records from the lagoon and fore-reef slope of Heron Reef, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Large inter-colony differences in Sr/Ca ratios were observed in the modern cores, suggesting that inter-branch skeleton may not be a suitable archive for absolute temperature reconstruction. Normalisation of each Sr/Ca record to the corresponding core mean does, however, remove these inter-colony differences and allows the reconstruction of the seasonal water temperature amplitude with a sensitivity of −0.05 ii mmol/mol/°C. Application of the resulting transfer equation to the modern inter-branch skeleton Sr/Ca record successfully identified the greater seasonal temperature range of the lagoon compared to the adjacent reef slope. A site-specific calibration also was completed for southern GBR Porites at Heron Reef using the reef slope water temperature record. Recent reef coring expeditions on Heron Reef have recovered Porites (U-Th dated at 5,216±0.041 years before present [BP] and 6,962±0.044 years BP) and corymbose Acropora (U-Th dated at 6,128±0.027 years BP) samples from the mid-Holocene. These cores represent the suggested period of 'mid-Holocene Thermal Maximum' and thus can provide significant insights into previous conditions in the southern GBR over a period somewhat analogous to present day warming. Temperature reconstructions from the two Porites cores suggest cooler summertime and mean annual temperatures compared to modern conditions. These results contrast previous reconstructions for the inshore central GBR, yet most likely represent differences in the environmental reconstruction (reef flat vs reef slope) and/or radiocarbon dating uncertainties, rather than a meridional difference in climate response to forcing.

Of these, physiological characteristics such as Symbiodinium density and size, chlorophyll a content and estimated productivity along a coast-reef scale (<1 km) remain to be thoroughly understood. In this study, we examined these characteristics seasonally in Acropora muricata colonies that harbor Symbiodinium clade A along a coast-reef scale in Belle Mare lagoon, Mauritius. The studied reef and coast habitats are characterized by contrasting thermal and light conditions as well as bleaching histories, with bleaching occurring only at the reef site in 2009. We observed higher symbiont density in winter for coast colonies but similar symbiont cell size compared to reef colonies. These two parameters showed seasonal variation. Chlorophyll a content was 30% lower in reef than coast colonies, irrespective of sampling season and was significantly influenced by site. Estimated productivity was influenced by both site and season, with summer samples of coast colonies displaying 56% higher values than reef colony samples.

Terdau was dominated by massive lifeform and in the East coast, Benuang plate was the most abundant lifeform. By using the coral morphology triangle, conservation value of reefs in all four stations was predicted using the percentage of coral lifeforms. Renggis and Teluk Dalam need to be conserved the most since the reefs are classified as ruderals (fast growing but very fragile). Reef in Benuang are classified as competitor. It grows slower than ruderal but has higher tolerance. Terdau's reef is mix of all categories.",en

The results showed that there was no transmission of white syndrome on healthy corals (Echinopora sp. and Montipora sp.). This was when the temperature of Sempu Island Nature Reserve was still in normal condition. High temperatures activated pathogenic bacteria in these waters and the chance of transmission of the disease was greater.

Investigating the reproductive biology of mesophotic corals is important to understand their life history traits. Despite an increase in research on mesophotic corals in the last decade, their reproductive biology is still poorly understood. Here, gametogenesis and fecundity of the Indo-Pacific mesophotic coral, Acropora tenella, were examined in an upper mesophotic reef (40 m depth) in Okinawa, Japan for the first time. Acropora tenella is a hermaphrodite with a single annual gametogenic cycle, and both oogenesis and spermatogenesis occurring for 11-12 and 5-6 months, respectively. Timing of spawning of this species was similar to other shallow Acropora spp. in the region. However, colonies had longer gametogenic cycles and less synchronous gamete maturation compared to shallow acroporids with spawning extended over consecutive months. Both the polyp fecundity (number of eggs per polyp) and gonad index (defined as the number of eggs per square centimeter) of A. tenella were lower than most acroporids. Our findings contribute to understanding of the life history of corals on mesophotic reefs and suggest that the reproductive biology of upper mesophotic corals is similar to that of shallow-water corals.",en

Unfortunately, coral reefs around the globe are declining, thus apart from marine protected areas, active conservation and restoration efforts are extremely crucial. In this study Acropora formosa nubbins were transplanted and their performance were monitored, with the main aim to evaluate their survivals and growth in comparison with natural reef. The extension growth, proto-branch generation, mortality and survivals were assessed for one year in Tioman Island, Malaysia. The A. formosa growth rates ranged from 0.59±0.07 to 1.20±0.03 cm mth-1 in the nursery and from 0.55±0.13 to 0.72±0.11 cm mth-1 in the natural reef. The transplanted corals exhibit higher growth rates particularly during early period of transplant, and moreover have significantly higher proto-branch generation rates compared with the natural colony. However, their survivals were significantly low, mostly due to predation by fish and other corallivores. Seasonal variations in coral growth were observed, with faster rates during the inter-monsoon period (March-April and October-November). This study for the first time, documented the success of A. formosa transplantation and its application in coral nurseries in Malaysian waters. Coral transplantation is highly beneficial for active coral reef restoration and conservation. Nevertheless, continuous long term, systematic monitoring are needed in order to have greater understanding of the A. formosa growth and dynamics in the tropical coral reef ecosystems.",en

However, with few exceptions reefs in Thailand are fringing reefs around continental islands, whether inshore or offshore. We describe patterns in coral community composition along a 70 km transect from the mainland to offshore islands in the southern Andaman Sea. We found that coral assemblages are comprised of two basic types. Differences in coral assemblages were associated with obviously different environmental conditions, including underwater visibility and level of suspended matter, which were not always aligned with distance from the mainland. While reef communities were quite variable between sites, the inshore coral assemblages tended to be characterized by higher numbers of Montipora, Pectinia, Podabacia, and Acropora compared to reefs around offshore islands. Offshore reefs were characterized by a relatively high number of Lobophyllia and Plerogyra colonies. The expected relationship between water quality and sensitive indicator groups like Acropora did not materialize with Acropora and Montipora being more common inshore. While there were strong inshore-offshore reef habitat differences in environmental conditions and reef communities in southern Thailand, they were not consistent with expectations from the literature.",en

The development of gametes was similar in both species, but there was no evidence for an adolescent protandrous period of development in G. aspera such as that recorded for G.favulus at Heron Island. Other reproductive differences between the two species were found in egg size and the mode of spawning. The eggs of G. aspera are smaller and more numerous than those of G.favulus. Goniastrea aspera expelled buoyant packets of eggs and sperm, while G.favulus had sticky sinking eggs which were released separately from the sperm. The spatial pattern of the two species was examined on the reef flat at Magnetic Island to determine whether the observed differences in spawning behaviour and egg buoyancy might have an effect on egg retention and the distribution of adult colonies. The results of this comparison failed to detect any difference in the degree of aggregation of the two species. This is not the result which would be expected if sticky sinking eggs helped retain developing larvae in the vicinity of the adult. These results, together with evidence from a wide range of coelenterates and observations on the larvae of G. aspera point to post spawning larval behaviour as the most likely factor in determining where these species will settle.",en

This research combines the concept of multispectral method and semantic computing to monitor ocean pollution by recognizing the coral condition and seawater quality based on the spectral feature. Our method proposes the semantic space creation based on natural-sensing and professional knowledge which can be interpreted the ocean condition using multimedia data (coral images and water parameters). The basic method of this research presented in The 28th International Conference on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases, (EJC 2018) on June 4-8, 2018 at Riga, Latvia, in the title of ""An environmental-semantic computing system of multispectral imagery for coral health monitoring and analysis"" Research Background Ocean pollution not only puts biodiversity at risk and but also affects economic activities, such as fisheries, aquaculture and tourism. Many scientists have been working on monitoring methods and technologies to alert the public authorities but the current methods that used for the detection of ocean pollution are expensive and take up several days to notify the users. Therefore, This study is looking to develop an real-time monitoring system for ocean pollution based on coral health condition and seawater quality in order to effectively and quickly detect pollution in oceans. This study presents a new environmental-semantic computing system of underwater multispectral imagery for coral health monitoring and water quality analysis using spectral feature. To realize this method, two main approaches can be identified: 1) To monitor coral condition based on multispectral image analysis and semantic computing concept and 2) To apply the concept of Sensing-Processing-Actuation (SPA) Process of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to support global coral reefs monitoring and analysis. As one of the analyzing functions, our system applies a semantic associative computing based on the Mathematical Model of Meaning(MMM) and multi-dimensional space to create ""Global-Ocean Environment-Analysis"". Significance of Research The main feature of our system is to realize semantic-search among coral reef-semantic spaces with multispectral databases (image and water spectral reflectance). The main feature of our system is to realize semantic-search among coral reef-semantic spaces with multispectral image databases. In our system, semantic associative search is realized in the 8-dimensional orthogonal multispectral semantic space with semantic projection functions. This space is created for dynamically computing semantic equivalence or similarity between coral image data resources and seawater quality parameters. This system utilize Acropora coral multispectral data and seawater quality (DO, Ocean acidification(pH), Turbidity, and Suspended Solid) to create a real-time environmental monitoring from actual location by using SPA (sensing, processing, and actuation) and the 5D World Map System, as an knowledge and analytic results sharing platform to report the global ocean condition. Research Approach This study applies the environmental-semantic space integration to realize deep ocean environmental analysis. In the design of this system, the main issue is to integrate the several environmental aspects and analyze environmental data resources with semantic interpretation. In this study, we present an environmental semantic computing system to realize integration and semantic-search among environmental semantic with seawater quality and coral image database which is the effective tool for ocean health monitoring system. According to our proposed method, spectral feature is the main characteristic of seawater and coral image data. This system acquires the spectral feature from the multispectral image and seawater spectral reflectance. Then, we apply a concept of semantic computing method with spectral feature by creating the multi spectral semantic image space in colors-based multidimensional semantic-image space related to semantic associative search method. The multi spectral semantic image space represents a semantic projection function for dynamically computing semantic equivalence, similarity and difference between multi spectral images and linguistic words. However, To realize and explain ocean environmental changes, we integrate two ""environmental-semantic space"" as (1) Multispectral image space, and (2) Seawater quality space in 8 dimensions"" which compose of four spectral channels (Red channel, Green channel, Blue channel, and Infrared) and four water parameters (DO, Ocean acidification(pH), Turbidity, and Suspended Solid).

This research also applies SPA function which can be allowed the users to get real-time coral monitoring and analysis.

We developed a headspace GC method for mass spectral analysis of DMSP in branching coral where hexa-deuterated DMSP (d 6-DMSP) was added to samples and standards to optimise the analytical precision and quantitative accuracy. Using this indirect HS-GC-MS method we show that common coral sample handling techniques did not alter DMSP concentrations in A. aspera, and that endogenous DMS was insignificant compared to the store of DMSP in A. aspera. Field application of the indirect HS-GC-MS method in all seasons over a five-year period at Heron Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef indicated that healthy colonies of A. aspera ordinarily seasonally conserve their branch tip store of DMSP; however, this store increased to a higher concentration under extended thermal stress conditions driven by a strong El Niño Southern Oscillation event. A liquid chromatography mass spectral method (LC-MS) was subsequently developed for direct analysis of DMSP in branching coral, also utilising the d 6-DMSP internal standard. The quantitative comparison of DMSP in four species of Acropora coral by indirect HS-GC-MS and direct LC-MS analysis gave equivalent concentrations in A. aspera only; in the other three species HS-GC-MS gave consistently higher concentrations, indicating that indirect analysis of DMSP may lead to artificially high values for some coral species.",en

From earliest records around the K-Pg event, the genus has a geo-history of strongly persistent morphological lineages, dating from 49 Mya to present and extending across the Eocene of England and Europe, Oligocene to early Miocene of Europe, Oligocene to present in the western Atlantic, and late Paleogene to present reef-bearing areas in the Indo-Pacific. Because of these records and the usually well-preserved Acropora fossils, it is regarded as an exemplar for studying modern diversity and distribution of reef corals and predicting their response to future climate change. Here we examine previously undocumented diversity of Acropora species groups present in Oligocene and Miocene (Suwannee Limestone and Tampa Member of the Arcadia Formation, respectively) deposits in Florida and southern Georgia, USA. We find evidence of both species-group lineages from the European region and novel, probably unique Atlantic lineages. Of 11 extant species-group lineages first present in the Eocene to Miocene of the European region, seven are present in this American material, including the cervicornis group, never recorded in the Indo-Pacific and now extant only in the western Atlantic. Two as yet undescribed species in the samples and the known species Acropora tampaensis Weisbord, 1973 could not be matched within the 19 species groups recognised in extant Acropora, and these may be lineages uniquely developed and lost in the Americas. The two species in the cervicornis species group, both now categorised as critically endangered, are the only surviving representatives of the family Acroporidae, which was previously represented by five genera in the western Atlantic. Acropora species from Florida and Georgia reefs clearly played a substantive role in the continuation and diversification of Acropora species groups during the Oligocene-Miocene in the western Atlantic and it is possible that this contributed to the success of the genus in the Indo-Pacific, as well as cervicornis group as a critical environmental feature of western Atlantic reefs.

The precise timing of spawning is thought to be controlled by a set of interacting environmental factors, including regional wind field patterns, timing of the sunset, and sea surface temperatures (SST). Climate change is resulting in increased SST, which is causing physiological stress in corals and could also be altering spawning synchrony and timing. In this study, we examined the effect of increasing seawater temperature by 2°C for 1 month prior to the predicted spawning time on reproduction in the coral Acropora digitifera. This short period of elevated temperature caused spawning to advance by 1 day. In animals incubated at elevated temperature, egg number per egg bundle did not change, however, egg volume significantly decreased as did sperm number. Our results indicate that temperature is acting both as a proximate cue to accelerate timing and as a stressor on gametogenesis to reduce fecundity. This finding suggests that increasing SSTs could play a dramatic role in altering reproductive timing and the success of corals in an era of climate change.",en

This study aimed to describe the effect of K. alvarezii seaweed cultivation activities on the growth and survival of coral Acropora muricata. The study was conducted using floating seaweed cultivation at two different water depths; 2 m and 5 m with space cultivation of 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm and control for each station. The results showed that the highest growth rates of stations I, II, and III (0.033±0.0020 cm, 0.040±0.0011 cm, 0.052 cm±0.0004), respectively and 0.052 ± 0.0004 cm in the control (2 m depth). While the lowest at stations I, II, and III (0.014±0.0014 cm, 0.019±0.0003 cm, 0.022±0.0005 cm) respectively, with the space of 10 cm at depth of 2 m. Two cultivation treatments with spacing and depth significantly affected the growth rate of A. muricata. Even though 5 m depth showed 100% of the survival rate of coral, the cultivation of K. alvarezii at depth level the coral reef ecosystem at a depth of 2 m negatively effect on A. muricata compared to 5 m.",en
EEC-5,NA,"Survival and growth of Acropora millepora coral fragments transplanted in turbid water of Sepulu, Bangkalan -Madura",NA,"Survival,Growth,Acropora millepora,Turbid water,Coral transplantation,Artificial reef","Turbidity and sedimentation are well known to be one of the major factors that limit the growth and development of Scleractinian corals, either in natural reef or transplanted coral for rehabilitation purpose. This study is aimed to access the survival and growth rate of Acropora millepora coral fragments transplanted on dome-shaped concrete artificial reef in the turbid coastal waters of Labuhan, Sepulu, Bangkalan-Madura. Ten units of dome-shaped concrete artificial reef containing 6 coral fragments deployed on the seafloor at depth ±3.5 meter in two different location (NW and NE) with relatively different turbidity. The observation of survival and growth rate were monthly basis; conducted in situ with Scuba diving technique. After 5 months, the results show that survival of corals was higher in NE location (92.22%) compared to NW location (88.89%). The growth rate of the corals was significantly differed (independent t-test, p = 0.001 at  = 0.05) with NE location have higher growth rate compared to NW (1.948±0.276-1.748±0.285 cm/month, respectively).",en
