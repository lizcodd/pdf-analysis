Acidified seawater resulted in fewer A. gemmifera larvae settling, and led to the production of smaller new recruits by slowing the development of the skeleton. The delayed development of new recruits due to elevated CO 2 was consistent with the downregulation of calcification related genes. Several genes related to HCO 3 − and Ca 2+ transporters were downregulated by elevated CO 2 , with solute carriers (SLC) (membrane transport proteins) possibly playing an important role. The downregulation of these membrane transport proteins might suppress the transport of calcium, bicarbonate and organic matter, resulting in the delayed development of A. gemmifera. Coral calcification is believed to be largely controlled by the degree of aragonite saturation (Ω A), and is significantly decreased by elevated atmospheric partial pressure CO 2 (pCO 2) 1-3 The early life stages of many marine organisms seem to be particularly vulnerable to acidified seawater. Consequently, there is an increasing concern about the potential impacts of increasing pCO 2 on corals during their early life stages 4. There are both pelagic and benthic phases in the coral life-cycle 5. The planktonic larvae of stony corals are non-calcifying until they settle, with a previous study documenting their morphological changes 6 (Fig. 1). After coral larvae settle, new recruits develop a calcifying base, and form a synapticular ring and septa to establish the structure of the coral skeleton. The skeletal morphology changes rapidly during the early life stage, suggesting that the expression of calcification related genes also changes 7. Coral growth and calcification are closely related to various protein transporters of Ca 2+ , H + and HCO 3 − 8-11 , as well as coral skeleton organic matrix proteins (SOMPs) 7,12,13. There has been detailed information on the settlement and metamorphosis of early life stages of coral 14,15. In addition, previous studies reported that high CO 2 affected the early life stage of coral, by delaying calcification and settlement 16-20 , modulating metabolism 21,22 , changing skeleton morphology 19,23 , and reducing survival and algal infection rates 24. Also, some studies showed that elevated CO 2 exhibited no significant effects on coral survival and corallite area 14,25. Gene expression has been analysed to understand the post-settlement success and skeleton formation of coral during the entire period of early development 26,27. Moya, et al. 28 used the Illumina RNAseq approach to study how acute exposure to elevated CO 2 affected the gene expression of the early life of Acropora millepora. The authors reported that the expression of most ion transport proteins was not affected by elevated CO 2 , while many membrane-associated or carbonic anhydrases were downregulated. Although corals lacked a strong response to elevated pCO 2 in the study of Rocker, et al. 29 , new recruits might have the capacity to acclimate rapidly to elevated pCO 2 by upregulating specific heat shock proteins (HSPs) and a suite of anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g. Bcl-2 family members) 30. Kaniewska, et al. 31 also demonstrated the upregulation of membrane transporters under high CO 2 concentrations, as well as the regulation of genes involved in the cytoskeletal interactions and cytoskeletal remodelling of membranes. The expression of heat shock proteins, carbonic anhydrase, and rubisco protein has also been studied in coral larvae 32-34 , supporting the assumption that elevated temperature and CO 2 are impacting coral development. Previous studies primarily used A. millepora as a model species in the analysis of gene expression. However, studies of other species might provide a more complete understanding of how coral communities respond to",en

This may occur at large scales, often resulting in significant decline in coral coverage. In order to understand the molecular and cellular basis of the ever-increasing incidence of coral bleaching, we have undertaken a comparative proteomic approach with the endangered Caribbean coral Acropora palmata. Using a proteomic tandem mass spectrometry approach, we identified 285 and 321 expressed protein signatures in bleached and unbleached A. palmata colonies, respectively, in southwestern Puerto Rico. Overall the expression level of 38 key proteins was significantly different between bleached and unbleached corals. A wide range of proteins was detected and categorized, including transcription factors involved mainly in heat stress/UV responses, immunity, apoptosis, biomineralization, the cytoskeleton, and endo-exophagocytosis. The results suggest that for bleached A. palmata, there was an induced differential protein expression response compared with those colonies that did not bleach under the same environmental conditions.",en

Although Caenorhabditis and Drosophila played key roles in establishing the molecular bases of apoptosis, it is now clear that cell death pathways of these animals do not reflect ancestral characteristics. Conversely, recent work suggests that the apoptotic networks of cnidarians may be complex and vertebrate-like, hence characterization of the apoptotic complement of representatives of the basal cnidarian class Anthozoa will help us to understand the evolution of the vertebrate apoptotic network. Results: We describe the Bcl-2 and caspase protein repertoires of the coral Acropora millepora, making use of the comprehensive transcriptomic data available for this species. Molecular phylogenetics indicates that some Acropora proteins are orthologs of specific mammalian pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, but the relationships of other Bcl-2 and caspases are unclear. The pro-or anti-apoptotic activities of coral Bcl-2 proteins were investigated by expression in mammalian cells, and the results imply functional conservation of the effector/anti-apoptotic machinery despite limited sequence conservation in the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. A novel caspase type (""Caspase-X""), containing both inactive and active caspase domains, was identified in Acropora and appears to be restricted to corals. When expressed in mammalian cells, full-length caspase-X caused loss of viability, and a truncated version containing only the active domain was more effective in inducing cell death, suggesting that the inactive domain might modulate activity in the full-length protein. Structure prediction suggests that the active and inactive caspase domains in caspase-X are likely to interact, resulting in a structure resembling that of the active domain in procaspase-8 and the inactive caspase domain in the mammalian c-FLIP anti-apoptotic factor. Conclusions: The data presented here confirm that many of the basic mechanisms involved in both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways were in place in the common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians. With the identification of most or all of the repertoires of coral Bcl-2 and caspases, our results not only provide new perspectives on the evolution of apoptotic pathways, but also a framework for future experimental studies towards a complete understanding of coral bleaching mechanisms, in which apoptotic cell death might be involved.",en

In the last decades coral reefs around the world have faced unprecedented degradation (Aronson et al., 2002; Pratchett et al., 2014; Hughes et al., 2017). In particular, rising sea surface temperature, due to global warming, in combination with high light intensity has been recognised as a prominent cause of coral bleaching and subsequently of mass coral mortality (Hughes, et al., 2018; Sully et al., 2019). However, spatial and temporal patterns of mass bleaching have been observed (Heron et al., 2016; Hughes, et al., 2018). Indeed, variable bleaching is known to be strongly influenced by unequal distribution of abiotic stresses (Guest et al., 2012;",en

In order to understand the impacts of projected climate change upon corals reefs, it is important to elucidate the underlying cellular mechanisms that operate during coral bleaching and subsequent mortality. In this respect, increased apoptotic cell death activity is an important cellular process that is associated with the breakdown of the mutualistic symbiosis between the cnidarian host and their dinoflagellate symbionts. Methodology/Principal Findings: The present study reports the impacts of different stressors (colchicine and heat stress) on three phases of apoptosis: (i) the potential initiation by differential expression of Bcl-2 members, (ii) the execution of apoptotic events by activation of caspase 3-like proteases and (iii) and finally, the cell disposal indicated by DNA fragmentation in the reef building coral Acropora millepora. In corals incubated with colchicine, an increase in caspase 3-like activity and DNA fragmentation was associated with a relative down-regulation of Bcl-2, suggesting that the initiation of apoptosis may be mediated by the suppression of an anti-apoptotic mechanism. In contrast, in the early steps of heat stress, the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis was related to a relative up-regulation of Bcl-2 consecutively followed by a delayed decrease in apoptosis activity. Conclusions/Significance: In the light of these results, we propose a model of heat stress in coral hosts whereby increasing temperatures engage activation of caspase 3-dependent apoptosis in cells designated for termination, but also the onset of a delayed protective response involving overexpression of Bcl-2 in surviving cells. This mitigating response to thermal stress could conceivably be an important regulatory mechanism for cell survival in corals exposed to sudden environmental changes.",en

Elevated temperatures directly or indirectly alter the distribution of coral-pathogen interactions and thereby exacerbate infectious coral diseases. The pathogenic bacterium Vibrio coralliilyticus is well-known as a causative agent of infectious coral disease. Rising sea surface temperature promotes the infection of corals by this bacterium, which causes several coral pathologies, such as bacterial bleaching, tissue lysis, and white syndrome. However, the effects of thermal stress on coral immune responses to the pathogen are poorly understood. To delineate the effects of thermal stress on coral immunity, we performed transcriptome analysis of aposymbiotic primary polyps of the reef-building coral Acropora digitifera exposed to V. coralliilyticus under thermal stress conditions. V. coralliilyticus infection of coral that was under thermal stress had negative effects on various molecular processes, including suppression of gene expression related to the innate immune response. In response to the pathogen, the coral mounted various responses including changes in protein metabolism, exosome release delivering signal molecules, extracellular matrix remodeling, and mitochondrial metabolism changes. Based on these results, we provide new insights into innate immunity of A. digitifera against pathogen infection under thermal stress conditions.",en

Comparison of 589 independent sequences from 1,421 A. palmata contigs, with 10,247 A. millepora contigs resulted in the identification of 196 putative homologues. Most of the homologous pairs demonstrated high amino acid similarities (over 90%). Comparisons of putative homologues showing low amino acid similarities (under 90%) among the Acropora species to the near complete datasets from two other cnidarians (Hydra magnipapillata and Nematostella vectensis) implied that some were non-orthologous. Within 86 homologous pairs, 39 exhibited dN/dS ratios significantly less than 1, suggesting that these genes are under purifying selection associated with functional constraints. Eight independent genes showed dN/dS ratios exceeding 1, while three deviated significantly from 1, suggesting that these genes may play important roles in the adaptive evolution of Acropora. Our results also indicated that CEL-III lectin was under positive selection, consistent with a possible role in immunity or symbiont recognition. Further studies are needed to clarify the possible functions of the genes under positive selection to provide insight into the evolutionary process of corals.",en

How the coral host responds to pathogen infection is an area where very little is known. Here we used next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to produce a transcriptome-wide profile of the immune response of the Staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis to White Band Disease (WBD) by comparing infected versus healthy (asymptomatic) coral tissues. The transcriptome of A. cervicornis was assembled de novo from A-tail selected Illumina mRNA-seq data from whole coral tissues, and parsed bioinformatically into coral and non-coral transcripts using existing Acropora genomes in order to identify putative coral transcripts. Differentially expressed transcripts were identified in the coral and non-coral datasets to identify genes that were up-and down-regulated due to disease infection. RNA-seq analyses indicate that infected corals exhibited significant changes in gene expression across 4% (1,805 out of 47,748 transcripts) of the coral transcriptome. The primary response to infection included transcripts involved in macrophage-mediated pathogen recognition and ROS production, two hallmarks of phagocytosis, as well as key mediators of apoptosis and calcium homeostasis. The strong up-regulation of the enzyme allene oxide synthase-lipoxygenase suggests a key role of the allene oxide pathway in coral immunity. Interestingly, none of the three primary innate immune pathways-Toll-like receptors (TLR), Complement, and prophenoloxydase pathways, were strongly associated with the response of A. cervicornis to infection. Five-hundred and fifty differentially expressed non-coral transcripts were classified as metazoan (n = 84), algal or plant (n = 52), fungi (n = 24) and protozoans (n = 13). None of the 52 putative Symbiodinium or algal transcript had any clear immune functions indicating that the immune response is driven by the coral host, and not its algal symbionts.",en

Understanding these early signals could be important for identifying the regulatory mechanisms responsible for bleaching and how these mechanisms vary between more and less resilient corals. Using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and sampling every 30 minutes during a short-term heat shock, we found that components of the transcriptome were significantly upregulated within 90 min and after a temperature increase of 12 7C. The developmental transcription factor, Krüppel-like factor 7, was highly expressed within 60 min, and stress-related transcription factors such as Elk-3 were highly expressed starting at 240 min. The sets of genes enriched for early transcriptional response to heat stress included heat shock proteins, small GTPases, and proteasome genes. Retrovirusrelated Pol polyproteins from transposons were significantly expressed throughout the whole experiment. Lastly, we propose a model for early transcriptional regulation of protein degradation and cell adhesion response that may ultimately lead to the bleaching and stress response.",en

In A. hyacinthus, the phytopigment concentrations at 28 and 30 o C were significantly different from 32 and 34 o C, implying a step-function response initiated between 30 and 32 o C. In P. solida, all phytopigments varied significantly between the temperatures, except in the case of total carotenoids which had no significant response. In F. complanata, all phytopigments decreased linearly as temperature increased.

Differences were apparent at all levels, with a greater diversity present in tissues of diseased colonies. The bacterial community associated with remote, non-diseased coral was distinct from the apparently healthy tissues of infected corals several cm from the disease lesion. This demonstrates a whole-organism effect from what appears to be a localised disease lesion, an effect that has also been recently demonstrated in white plague-like disease in star coral Montastraea annularis. The pattern of bacterial community structure changes was similar to that recently demonstrated for white plague-like disease and black band disease. Some of the changes are likely to be explained by the colonisation of dead and degrading tissues by a micro-heterotroph community adapted to the decomposition of coral tissues. However, specific ribosomal types that are absent from healthy tissues appear consistently in all samples of each of the diseases. These ribotypes are closely related members of a group of α-proteobacteria that cause disease, notably juvenile oyster disease, in other marine organisms. It is clearly important that members of this group are isolated for challenge experiments to determine their role in the diseases.",en

The causes of this phenomenon, however, remain enigmatic. To unravel the mechanisms underlying the increased heat tolerance, we applied different thermal treatments to the scleractinian coral Acropora pruinosa and studied the resulting differences in appearance, physiological index, Symbiodiniaceae and bacterial communities, and transcriptome response. We found that early heat stress improved the thermal tolerance of the coral holobiont. After thermal acclimation, the community structure and symbiotic bacterial diversity in the microbiota were reorganized, whereas those of Symbiodiniaceae remained stable. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the downregulated coral host genes were mainly involved in pathways relating to metabolism, particularly the nitrogen metabolism pathway. This indicates that thermal acclimation led to decrease in the metabolism level in the coral host, which might be a self-protection mechanism. We suggest that thermal acclimation may increase scleractinian coral thermal tolerance by slowing host metabolism, altering the dominant bacterial population, and increasing bacterial diversity. This study offers new insights into the adaptive potential of scleractinian coral to heat stress from global warming.",en

Despite the importance of these systems, major gaps remain in our understanding of how thermal stress and bleaching affect the metabolic networks that underpin holobiont function. We applied gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics to detect changes in the intracellular free metabolite pools (polar and semi-polar compounds) of in hospite dinoflagellate symbionts and their coral hosts (and any associated microorganisms) during early-and late-stage thermal bleaching (a reduction of approximately 50 and 70% in symbiont density, respectively). We detected characteristic changes to the metabolite profiles of each symbiotic partner associated with individual cellular responses to thermal, oxidative and osmotic stress, which progressed with the severity of bleaching. Alterations were also indicative of changes to energy-generating and biosynthesis pathways in both partners, with a shift to the increased catabolism of lipid stores. Specifically, in symbiont intracellular metabolite pools, we observed accumulations of multiple free fatty acids, plus the chloroplast-associated antioxidant alpha-tocopherol. In the host, we detected a decline in the abundance of pools of multiple carbohydrates, amino acids and intermediates, in addition to the antioxidant ascorbate. These findings further our understanding of the metabolic changes that occur to symbiont and host (and its associated microorganisms) during thermal bleaching. These findings also provide further insight into the largely undescribed roles of free metabolite pools in cellular homeostasis, signalling and acclimation to thermal stress in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis.

As a first step to understand how P. damicornis planulae attain high stress tolerance, we compared the respiration rate and temperature dependence between symbiotic planulae of P. damicornis and non-symbiotic planulae of A. tenuis, as well as between larvae and adult branches within each species. Larvae and adult branches of both species had similar temperature dependency of respiration rate, with the temperature coefficient (Q10) values of about 2. Planula larvae of P. damicornis had a significantly lower respiration rate than that of A. tenuis larvae at 25-30 °C, but not at 32 °C, whereas adult branches of P. damicornis had a significantly higher respiration rate than that of A. tenuis branches at all temperatures.

Here we explore growth and the expression of 20 target genes with putative roles in metabolism and calcification in the branching coral, Acropora millepora, in two separate experiments: 1) elevated pCO 2 (464, 822, 1187 and 1638 μatm) and ambient temperature (27°C), and 2) elevated pCO 2 (490 and 822 μatm) and temperature (28 and 31°C). After 14 days of exposure to elevated pCO 2 and ambient temperatures, no evidence of differential expression of either calcification or metabolism genes was detected between control and elevated pCO 2 treatments. After 37 days of exposure to control and elevated pCO 2 , Ubiquinol-Cytochrome-C Reductase Subunit 2 gene (QCR2; a gene involved in complex III of the electron chain transport within the mitochondria and critical for generation of ATP) was significantly down-regulated in the elevated pCO 2 treatment in both ambient and elevated temperature treatments. Overall, the general absence of a strong response to elevated pCO 2 and temperature by the other 19 targeted calcification and metabolism genes suggests that corals may not be affected by these stressors on longer time scales (37 days). These results also highlight the potential for QCR2 to act as a biomarker of coral genomic responses to changing environments.",en

Indeed, in early ontogeny, when corals acquire and establish associations with various surface microbiota and dinoflagellate endosymbionts, they do not efficiently distinguish between closely and distantly related individuals from the same population. However, very little is known about the molecular components that underpin allorecognition and immunity responses or how they change through early ontogeny in corals. Methodology/Principal Findings: Patterns in the expression of four putative immune response genes (apextrin, complement C3, and two CELIII type lectin genes) were examined in juvenile colonies of Acropora millepora throughout a six-month post-settlement period using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Expression of a CELIII type lectin gene peaked in the fourth month for most of the coral juveniles sampled and was significantly higher at this time than at any other sampling time during the six months following settlement. The timing of this increase in expression levels of putative immune response genes may be linked to allorecognition maturation which occurs around this time in A.millepora. Alternatively, the increase may represent a response to immune challenges, such as would be involved in the recognition of symbionts (such as Symbiodinium spp. or bacteria) during winnowing processes as symbioses are fine-tuned. Conclusions/Significance: Our data, although preliminary, are consistent with the hypothesis that lectins may play an important role in the maturation of allorecognition responses in corals. The co-expression of lectins with apextrin during development of coral juveniles also raises the possibility that these proteins, which are components of innate immunity in other invertebrates, may influence the innate immune systems of corals through a common pathway or system. However, further studies investigating the expression of these genes in alloimmune-challenged corals are needed to further clarify emerging evidence of a complex innate immunity system in corals.",en

Zooxanthellae within the tissue of A. nasuta were classified into 3 types based on their coloration and shape: healthy-looking zooxanthellae (Hz.), pale zooxanthellae (Pz.) and transparent zooxanthellae (Tz.). The Pz. were pale yellow with more or less disorganized cellular content, while Tz. were swelled and vacuolated with no pigmentation. Tz. were the dominant zooxanthellae in colonies that suffered severe bleaching, while non-bleached colonies and those recovered from bleaching had mostly Hz. Some Tz, were ruptured with vacuoles spreading out of the cell. The density of zooxanthellae in severely bleached colonies was about 105 cells cm-2. The present observation suggests that, during natural bleaching due to chronic stress, zooxanthellae remained in host tissue lose pigmentation and become swelled and vacuolated suggesting necrotic death of the zooxanthellae.",en

This is especially worrying for the Caribbean branching coral Acropora palmata which has already seen an 80% decrease in cover primarily due to disease. Despite the importance of this keystone species, there has yet to be a characterization of its transcriptomic response to disease exposure. In this study we provide the first transcriptomic analysis of 12 A. palmata genotypes and their symbiont Symbiodiniaceae exposed to disease in 2016 and 2017. Year was the primary driver of gene expression variance for A. palmata and the Symbiodiniaceae. We hypothesize that lower expression of ribosomal genes in the coral, and higher expression of transmembrane ion transport genes in the Symbiodiniaceae indicate that a compensation or dysbiosis may be occurring between host and symbiont. Disease response was the second driver of gene expression variance for A. palmata and included a core set of 422 genes that were significantly differentially expressed. Of these, 2 genes (a predicted cyclin-dependent kinase 11b and aspartate 1-decarboxylase) showed negative Log2 fold changes in corals showing transmission of disease, and positive Log2 fold changes in corals showing no transmission of disease, indicating that these may be important in disease resistance. Co-expression analysis identified two modules positively correlated to disease exposure, one enriched for lipid biosynthesis genes, and the other enriched in innate immune genes. The hub gene in the immune module was identified as D-amino acid oxidase, a gene implicated in phagocytosis and microbiome homeostasis. The role of D-amino acid oxidase in coral immunity has not been characterized but could be an important enzyme for responding to disease. Our results indicate that A. palmata mounts a core immune response to disease exposure despite differences in the disease type and virulence between 2016 and 2017. These identified genes may be important for future biomarker development in this Caribbean keystone species.",en

Understanding how much individuals within a population vary in their thermal tolerance and whether this variation is heritable is important in determining whether a species can adapt to climate change. To address this, Acropora cervicornis fragments from 20 genetically distinct colonies collected from the Coral Restoration Foundation Tavernier nursery (Florida, USA) were kept at either ambient (28 ± 1°C) or elevated (32 ± 1°C) temperatures, and mortality was monitored for 26 d. Both broad-sense (H 2) and narrow-sense (h 2) heritability of thermal tolerance were estimated to determine the amount of genetic variation underlying survival to elevated temperature. To understand the physiological basis of thermal tolerance, tissue from both treatments was taken 12 h after the start of the experiment to investigate gene expression at the mRNA and protein level between tolerant and susceptible colonies. Results revealed that this population has considerable total genetic variation in thermal tolerance (H 2 = 0.528), but low variance in relatedness among colonies prevented us from making any conclusions regarding h 2. Despite high transcriptomic variability among and within colonies, 40 genes were consistently and significantly different between tolerant and susceptible colonies, and could be potential biomarkers for thermal tolerance should they be verified in a larger sample. Overall, the results suggest that this population has substantial genetic variation for traits that directly impact thermal tolerance; however, their response to projected increases in temperature will depend on more precise estimates of the additive components of this variation (h 2).",en

Algal endosymbionts, specifically the dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium, are divided into several genetic clades. The composition of Symbiodinium within corals plays an important role in the tolerance and/or sensitivity of host corals to local environments, due to individual Symbiodinium-specific physiological characteristics. While the majority of gamete-spawning corals acquire Symbiodinium from the surrounding environment, little is known about whether corals specifically select or randomly acquire Symbiodinium from the environmental population. In the present study, we compared the Symbiodinium clade composition of newly recruited Acropora corals with that of the environmental pool (water column, sediments, and adult colonies). More than 90 % of recruits harbored clades A and/or D until 6 months after settlement, despite the Symbiodinium environmental pool being mainly composed of clade C (mainly ITS1 type C2), and to a lesser extent clades A and D. In addition, the environmentally dominant type C2 Symbiodinium was not detected in Acropora recruits, while a few recruits harbored ITS1 types C1 or C15. Therefore, the clade composition of recruits may not reflect the abundance/density of Symbiodinium populations in the environment. Some members of clades A and D are known to exhibit tolerance to a wide range of environments. ITS1 type C1 also exhibits greater tolerance to thermal stress compared to ITS1 type C2. These tolerance characteristics of certain Symbiodinium may be vital for the initial survival of Acropora recruits, even if these Symbiodinium are rare in the environment.",en

Colonies of A. palmata in Haulover Bay, within Virgin Islands National Park, St. John, were examined monthly in situ for signs of disease and other stressors from January 2003 through December 2009. During the study, 89.9 % of the colonies (n = 69) exhibited disease, including white pox (87 %), white band (13 %), and unknown (9 %). Monthly disease prevalence ranged from 0 to 57 %, and disease was the most significant cause of complete colony mortality (n = 17). A positive correlation was found between water temperature and disease prevalence, but not incidence. Annual average disease prevalence and incidence remained constant during the study. Colonies generally showed an increase in the estimated amount of total living tissue from growth, but 25 (36.2 %) of the colonies died. Acropora palmata bleached in the USVI for the first time during the 2005 Caribbean bleaching event. Only one of the 23 colonies that bleached appeared to die directly from bleaching. In 2005, corals that bleached had greater disease prevalence than those that did not bleach. Just over half (52 %) of the colonies incurred some physical damage. Monitoring of fragments (broken branches) that were generated by physical damage through June 2007 showed that 46.1 % died and 28.4 % remained alive; the fragments that attached to the substrate survived longer than those that did not. Recent surveys showed an increase in the total number of colonies within the reef area, formed from both asexual and sexual reproduction. Genotype analysis of 48 of the originally monitored corals indicated that 43 grew from sexual recruits supporting the conclusion that both asexual and sexual reproduction are contributing to an increase in colony density at this site.",en

Cataloging genes expressed in Acropora palmata, a foundation-species of reefs in the Caribbean and western Atlantic, will advance our understanding of the genetic basis of ecologically important traits in corals and comes at a time when sequencing efforts in other cnidarians allow for multi-species comparisons. Results: A cDNA library from a sample enriched for symbiont free larval tissue was sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Over 960,000 reads were obtained and assembled into 42,630 contigs. Annotation data was acquired for 57% of the assembled sequences. Analysis of the assembled sequences indicated that 83-100% of all A. palmata transcripts were tagged, and provided a rough estimate of the total number genes expressed in our samples (,18,000-20,000). The coral annotation data contained many of the same molecular components as in the Bilateria, particularly in pathways associated with oxidative stress and DNA damage repair, and provided evidence that homologs of p53, a key player in DNA repair pathways, has experienced selection along the branch separating Cnidaria and Bilateria. Transcriptome wide screens of paralog groups and transition/transversion ratios highlighted genes including: green fluorescent proteins, carbonic anhydrase, and oxidative stress proteins; and functional groups involved in protein and nucleic acid metabolism, and the formation of structural molecules. These results provide a starting point for study of adaptive evolution in corals. Conclusions: Currently available transcriptome data now make comparative studies of the mechanisms underlying coral's evolutionary success possible. Here we identified candidate genes that enable corals to maintain genomic integrity despite considerable exposure to genotoxic stress over long life spans, and showed conservation of important physiological pathways between corals and bilaterians.",en

The current consensus is that this phenomenon results from enhanced production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) that disrupt the symbiosis between corals and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, Symbiodinium. Here, the responses of two important antioxidant defence components, the host coenzyme Q (CoQ) and symbiont plastoquinone (PQ) pools, are investigated for the first time in colonies of the scleractinian coral, Acropora millepora, during experimentally-induced bleaching under ecologically relevant conditions. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to quantify the states of these two pools, together with physiological parameters assessing the general state of the symbiosis (including photosystem II photochemical efficiency, chlorophyll concentration and Symbiodinium cell densities). The results show that the responses of the two antioxidant systems occur on different timescales: (i) the redox state of the Symbiodinium PQ pool remained stable until twelve days into the experiment, after which there was an abrupt oxidative shift; (ii) by contrast, an oxidative shift of approximately 10% had occurred in the host CoQ pool after 6 days of thermal stress, prior to significant changes in any other physiological parameter measured. Host CoQ pool oxidation is thus an early biomarker of thermal stress in corals, and this antioxidant pool is likely to play a key role in quenching thermally-induced ROS in the coral-algal symbiosis. This study adds to a growing body of work that indicates host cellular responses may precede the bleaching process and symbiont dysfunction.",en

To examine the molecular response of the coral Acropora microphthalma to high levels of solar irradiance, a cDNA library was constructed by PCR-based suppression subtractive hybridisation (PCR-SSH) from mRNA obtained by transplantation of a colony from a depth of 12.7 m to near-surface solar irradiance, during which the coral became noticeably paler from loss of endosymbionts in sun-exposed tissues. Methodology/Principal Findings: A novel approach to sequence annotation of the cDNA library gave genetic evidence for a hypothetical biosynthetic pathway branching from the shikimic acid pathway that leads to the formation of 4deoxygadusol. This metabolite is a potent antioxidant and expected precursor of the UV-protective mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), which serve as sunscreens in coral phototrophic symbiosis. Empirical PCR based evidence further upholds the contention that the biosynthesis of these MAA sunscreens is a 'shared metabolic adaptation' between the symbiotic partners. Additionally, gene expression induced by enhanced solar irradiance reveals a cellular mechanism of light-induced coral bleaching that invokes a Ca 2+-binding synaptotagmin-like regulator of SNARE protein assembly of phagosomal exocytosis, whereby algal partners are lost from the symbiosis. Conclusions/Significance: Bioinformatics analyses of DNA sequences obtained by differential gene expression of a coral exposed to high solar irradiance has revealed the identification of putative genes encoding key steps of the MAA biosynthetic pathway. Revealed also by this treatment are genes that implicate exocytosis as a cellular process contributing to a breakdown in the metabolically essential partnership between the coral host and endosymbiotic algae, which manifests as coral bleaching.",en

In this study, we evaluated the effects of thermal stress and CO 2-driven acidified seawater on fertilization in a reefbuilding coral, Acropora digitifera. The fertilization rates of A. digitifera decreased in response to thermal stress compared with those under normal seawater conditions. In contrast, the changes of fertilization rates were not evident in the acidified seawater. Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) predicted that sperm/egg crosses and temperature were explanatory variables in the best-fitted model for the fertilization data. In the best model, interactions between thermal stress and acidified seawater on the fertilization rates were not selected. Our results suggested that coral fertilization is more sensitive to future GW than OA. Taking into consideration the previous finding that sperm motility of A. digitifera was decreased by acidified seawater, the decrease in coral cover followed by that of sperm concentration might cause the interacting effects of GW and OA on coral fertilization.",en

We exposed fragments of eight Acropora millepora colonies (genotypes) to putatively pathogenic bacteria (Vibrio spp.). Genotypes varied from zero to >90% mortality, with bacterial challenge increasing average mortality rates 4-6 fold and shifting the microbiome in favor of stress-associated taxa. Constitutive immunity and subsequent immune and transcriptomic responses to the challenge were more prominent in high-mortality individuals, whereas low-mortality corals remained largely unaffected and maintained expression signatures of a healthier condition (i.e., did not launch a large stress response). Our results suggest that lesions appeared due to changes in the coral pathobiome (multiple bacterial species associated with disease) and general health deterioration after the biotic disturbance, rather than the direct activity of any specific pathogen. If diseases in nature arise because of weaknesses in holobiont physiology, instead of the virulence of any single etiological agent, environmental stressors compromising coral condition might play a larger role in disease outbreaks than is currently thought. To facilitate the diagnosis of compromised individuals, we developed and independently cross-validated a biomarker assay to predict mortality based on genes whose expression in asymptomatic individuals coincides with mortality rates. Global declines in coral cover are compounded by a variety of diseases 1, 2 , many of which are ambiguously defined by macroscopic characterizations of lesions 1-3. Several bacterial species from the genus Vibrio have been implicated as etiological agents of some coral diseases 4-6 , but these bacteria may act merely as opportunistic pathogens exploiting compromised hosts 7. The reported presence of pathogens on healthy colonies 8 and diversity of bacterial species associated with diseased colonies 9, 10 suggests that many instances of that coral disease cannot be attributed to a single pathogen. Instead, multiple bacteria appear to act opportunistically during coral disease events 11. To describe these recurrent phenomena in coral disease biology, researchers have recently introduced the concept of the pathobiome 12. Instead of a single etiological agent, the pathobiome consists of all microbiota that contribute to disease and describes interactive effects between microbiome members and environmental conditions 13. Host immune health is considered to be a major determinant of disease transmission dynamics 14, 15. Corals, like all invertebrates, rely entirely on innate immunity for protection from invading pathogens. Features of innate immunity in corals include molecular pattern recognition 16 , secreted antimicrobial macromolecules 17 , cellular responses (e.g., phagocytosis) 18, 19 , and physical barriers (e.g., mucus) 20, 21. Melanin deposits serve as another physical barrier against invading pathogens 22.

Cell viability of the two studied corals was similar at 26 and 29°C, but depicted a sharp decline of zooxanthellae lost at 31°C through time. As the temperature increased to 35°C, the loss of zooxanthellae from each host increased both with time and temperature elevation. The coral A. humilis had a higher decrease in its zooxanthellae densities than S. pistillata at the same treatment. Bleaching temperature threshold was 33°C or less for the two species S. pistillata and A. humilis where 51% of their zooxanthellae were lost after 24 h of exposure. In samples exposed to sediment concentration of 0.1 mg/cm 2 /L, zooxanthellae densities of A. humilis and S. pistillata did not show any decrease after 1 day. However, after 1 day of exposure to 0.5 mg/cm 2 /L, zooxanthellae densities were significantly different from those of the controls. Increases in sediment concentration to 1 mg/cm 2 /L caused a decrease in zooxanthellae densities that vary greatly over time. Measurements of zooxanthellae densities of A. humilis and S. pistillata at this stage revealed a highly significant difference between exposed and control sample. At 1 g/cm 2 /L, the number of zooxanthellae lost from A. humilis was higher than those lost from S. pistillata at same time.

These rhythms are often controlled by light, and daily cycles of solar illumination entrain many clock regulated processes. In scleractinian corals a number of different processes and behaviors are associated with specific periods of solar illumination or nonillumination-for example, skeletal deposition, feeding and both brooding and broadcast spawning. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have undertaken an analysis of diurnal expression of the whole transcriptome and more focused studies on a number of candidate circadian genes in the coral Acropora millepora using deep RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR. Many examples of diurnal cycles of RNA abundance were identified, some of which are light responsive and damped quickly under constant darkness, for example, cryptochrome 1 and timeless, but others that continue to cycle in a robust manner when kept in constant darkness, for example, clock, cryptochrome 2, cycle and eyes absent, indicating that their transcription is regulated by an endogenous clock entrained to the light-dark cycle. Many other biological processes that varied between day and night were also identified by a clustering analysis of gene ontology annotations. Conclusions/Significance: Corals exhibit diurnal patterns of gene expression that may participate in the regulation of circadian biological processes. Rhythmic cycles of gene expression occur under constant darkness in both populations of coral larvae that lack zooxanthellae and in individual adult tissue containing zooxanthellae, indicating that transcription is under the control of a biological clock.

Despite large variation among biological replicates, the majority of GOIs were up-regulated (up to 4000%) in most colonies during a laboratory-based thermal stress experiment. Two genes, Nf-kb2 and MnSod, were consistently up-regulated in all colonies tested, and we therefore propose these as candidate markers useful for population-level evaluations of thermal stress.

Until recently, DMSP was believed to be synthesized exclusively by photosynthetic organisms; however we now know that corals and specific bacteria can also produce this compound. Corals are major sources of DMSP, but the molecular basis for its biosynthesis is unknown in these organisms. Results: Here we used salinity stress, which is known to trigger DMSP production in other organisms, in conjunction with transcriptomics to identify coral genes likely to be involved in DMSP biosynthesis. We focused specifically on both adults and juveniles of the coral Acropora millepora: after 24 h of exposure to hyposaline conditions, DMSP concentrations increased significantly by 2.6 fold in adult corals and 1.2 fold in juveniles. Concomitantly, candidate genes enabling each of the necessary steps leading to DMSP production were up-regulated. Conclusions: The data presented strongly suggest that corals use an algal-like pathway to generate DMSP from methionine, and are able to rapidly change expression of the corresponding genes in response to environmental stress. However, our data also indicate that DMSP is unlikely to function primarily as an osmolyte in corals, instead potentially serving as a scavenger of ROS and as a molecular sink for excess methionine produced as a consequence of proteolysis and osmolyte catabolism in corals under hypo-osmotic conditions.",en

We found that both light and dark calcification rates of Sesoko corals did not change with an increase in seawater pCO 2 , while the calcification rates of Bise corals significantly decreased. Additionally, calcification rate of Sesoko corals was significantly lower than Bise corals at control conditions. Expressions of two putative calcification-related genes (BAT: bicarbonate transporter and galaxin) were up-regulated at high CO 2 compared to the control and expression of the BAT gene was significantly higher in Sesoko compared to Bise corals. Consequently, differences in the calcification rate between populations and differences in the expression of genes related to inorganic carbon transport regulation could be reasons that explain the difference in the response to OA between the two populations. Furthermore, taking into account that Sesoko corals were located in relatively nearshore areas where the environmental conditions are more variable, while Bise corals were located in the forereef which shows more stable conditions, plasticity for coral calcification in response to different environmental conditions and/or acclimation response to changes such as seawater pCO 2 may lead to differences in sensitivity between the two populations to high seawater pCO 2.

This study explored the transcriptional response of two putative immune genes (c3 and c-type lectin) and one stress response gene (hsp70) in the reef building coral, Acropora millepora challenged for 48 hours with bacterial strains, Vibrio coralliilyticus and Alteromonas sp. at concentrations of 10 6 cells ml-1. Coral fragments challenged with V. coralliilyticus appeared healthy while fragments challenged with Alteromonas sp. showed signs of tissue lesions after 48 hr. Coral-associated bacterial community profiles assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis changed after challenge by both bacterial strains with the Alteromonas sp. treatment demonstrating the greatest community shift. Transcriptional profiles of c3 and hsp70 increased at 24 hours and correlated with disease signs in the Alteromonas sp. treatment. The expression of hsp70 also showed a significant increase in V. coralliilyticus inoculated corals at 24 h suggesting that even in the absence of disease signs, the microbial inoculum activated a stress response in the coral. C-type lectin did not show a response to any of the bacterial treatments. Increase in gene expression of c3 and hsp70 in corals showing signs of disease indicates their potential involvement in immune and stress response to microbial challenges.",en

However, the genetic basis for the success and wide distribution of Acropora are unknown. Here, we sequenced complete genomes of 15 Acropora species and 3 other acroporid taxa belonging to the genera Montipora and Astreopora to examine genomic novelties that explain their evolutionary success. We successfully obtained reasonable draft genomes of all 18 species. Molecular dating indicates that the Acropora ancestor survived warm periods without sea ice from the mid or late Cretaceous to the Early Eocene and that diversification of Acropora may have been enhanced by subsequent cooling periods. In general, the scleractinian gene repertoire is highly conserved; however, coral-or cnidarian-specific possible stress response genes are tandemly duplicated in Acropora. Enzymes that cleave dimethlysulfonioproprionate into dimethyl sulfide, which promotes cloud formation and combats greenhouse gasses, are the most duplicated genes in the Acropora ancestor. These may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer from algal symbionts belonging to the family Symbiodiniaceae, or from coccolithophores, suggesting that although functions of this enzyme in Acropora are unclear, Acropora may have survived warmer marine environments in the past by enhancing cloud formation. In addition, possible antimicrobial peptides and symbiosisrelated genes are under positive selection in Acropora, perhaps enabling adaptation to diverse environments. Our results suggest unique Acropora adaptations to ancient, warm marine environments and provide insights into its capacity to adjust to rising seawater temperatures.",en

It resembled but was not closely related to damicornin, the only other known AMP from a coral, and was shown to be active against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. These proteins define a family of AMPs present in corals and their close relatives, the Corallimorpharia, and are synthesised as preproproteins in which the C-terminal mature peptide contains a conserved arrangement of six cysteine residues. Consistent with the idea of a common origin for AMPs and toxins, this Cys motif is shared between the coral AMPs and the Shk neurotoxins of sea anemones. AmAMP1 is expressed at late stages of coral development, in ectodermal cells that resemble the ""ganglion neurons"" of Hydra, in which it has recently been demonstrated that a distinct AMP known as NDA-1 is expressed.",en

Identification of gene expression changes within corals in response to contact with macroalgae can provide insight into the mode of action of allelochemicals, as well as reveal transcriptional strategies of the coral that mitigate damage from this competitive interaction, enabling the coral to survive. Gene expression responses of the coral Acropora millepora after long-term (20 days) direct contact with macroalgae (Chlorodesmis fastigiata, Dictyota bartayresiana, Galaxaura filamentosa, and Turbinaria conoides) and shortterm (1 and 24 h) exposure to C. fastigiata thalli and their hydrophobic extract were assessed. After 20 days of exposure, T. conoides thalli elicited no significant change in visual bleaching or zooxanthellae PSII quantum yield within A. millepora nubbins, but stimulated the greatest alteration in gene expression of all treatments. Chlorodesmis fastigiata, D. bartayresiana, and G. filamentosa caused significant visual bleaching of coral nubbins and reduced the PSII quantum yield of associated zooxanthellae after 20 days, but elicited fewer changes in gene expression relative to T. conoides at day 20. To evaluate initial molecular processes leading to reduction of zooxanthella PSII quantum yield, visual bleaching, and coral death, short-term exposures to C. fastigiata thalli and hydrophobic extracts were conducted; these interactions revealed protein degradation and significant changes in catalytic and metabolic activity within 24 h of contact. These molecular responses are consistent with the hypothesis that allelopathic interactions lead to alteration of signal transduction and an imbalance between reactive oxidant species production and antioxidant capabilities within the coral holobiont. This oxidative imbalance results in rapid protein degradation and eventually to apoptosis and/or necrosis when compensatory transcriptional action by the coral holobiont insufficiently mitigates damage by the allelochemicals of C. fastigiata.",en

This has motivated efforts to understand mechanisms of coral resilience to environmental stress. A popular method for approaching such questions is profiling genome-wide gene expression using RNA-seq (Drury, 2019). Often, these studies focus on a single stressor and seek to identify genes and pathways that underlie the adaptive responses to it. However, in isolation, these studies cannot differentiate between gene regulation specific to a particular stressor, and gene expression changes reflecting stress in general. For this reason, delineation of corals' general stress response is needed to understand how they contend with suboptimal conditions.

The responses of corals associated with different Symbiodinium clades to thermal stress are not well understood, especially at a gene expression level. Juveniles of the coral Acropora tenuis inoculated with different algal types (clade A or D) were exposed to thermal stress and the expression levels of four putative stress-responsive genes, including genes coding green and red fluorescent proteins, an oxidative stress-responsive protein, and an ascorbic acid transporter, were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression levels of the four genes decreased at high temperatures if juveniles were associated with clade A symbionts but increased if the symbionts were in clade D. The intensity of green fluorescence increased with temperature in clade D symbionts harboring juveniles, but not in juveniles associated with clade A symbionts.

Reef-building corals are increasingly exposed to local and global stressors that alter nutritional status causing reduced fitness and mortality, however, these responses can vary considerably across species and populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compare the expression of 22 coral host genes in individuals from an inshore and an offshore reef location using quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) over the course of 26 days following translocation into a shaded, filtered seawater environment. Declines in lipid content and PSII activity of the algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium ITS-1 type C2) over the course of the experiment indicated that heterotrophic uptake and photosynthesis were limited, creating nutritional deprivation conditions. Regulation of coral host genes involved in metabolism, CO 2 transport and oxidative stress could be detected already after five days, whereas PSII activity took twice as long to respond. Opposing expression trajectories of Tgl, which releases fatty acids from the triacylglycerol storage, and Dgat1, which catalyses the formation of triglycerides, indicate that the decline in lipid content can be attributed, at least in part, by mobilisation of triacylglycerol stores. Corals from the inshore location had initially higher lipid content and showed consistently elevated expression levels of two genes involved in metabolism (aldehyde dehydrogenase) and calcification (carbonic anhydrase). Conclusions/Significance: Coral host gene expression adjusts rapidly upon change in nutritional conditions, and therefore can serve as an early signature of imminent coral stress. Consistent gene expression differences between populations indicate that corals acclimatize and/or adapt to local environments. Our results set the stage for analysis of these processes in natural coral populations, to better understand the responses of coral communities to global climate change and to develop more efficient management strategies.",en

Symbiodinium photosynthetic efficiency (F v /F m) was significantly depressed by the bleaching event, while elevated pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2) slightly mitigated the effects of increased temperature on F v /F m during the final 4 d of the recovery period, however, did not affect the loss of symbionts. Elevated pCO 2 alone had no effect on F v /F m or symbiont density. Expression of targeted Symbiodinium genes involved in carbon metabolism and heat stress response was not significantly altered by either increased temperature and/or CO 2. Of the selected host genes, two carbonic anhydrase isoforms (coCA2 and coCA3) exhibited the largest changes, most notably in crossed bleaching and elevated pCO 2 treatments. CA2 was significantly down-regulated on day 14 in all treatments, with the greatest decrease in the crossed treatment (relative expression compared to control = 0.16; p \ 0.05); CA3 showed a similar trend, with expression levels 0.20-fold of controls on day 14 (p \ 0.05) in the elevated temperature/ pCO 2 treatment.

These tools hold great promise in elucidating novel and unforeseen cellular processes underlying the successful mutualism between corals and their dinoflagellate endosymbionts Symbiodinium spp. Since thermal stress triggers a breakdown in the symbiosis (coral bleaching), measuring the transcriptomic response to thermal stress-induced bleaching offers an extraordinary view of cellular processes that are specific to coral-algal symbioses. In the present study, we utilized a cDNA microarray containing 2059 genes of the threatened Caribbean elkhorn coral Acropora palmata to identify genes that are differentially expressed upon thermal stress. Fragments from replicate colonies were exposed to elevated temperature for 2 d, and samples were frozen for microarray analysis after 24 and 48 h. Totals of 204 and 104 genes were differentially expressed in samples that were collected 1 and 2 d after thermal stress, respectively. Analysis of the differentially expressed genes indicates a cellular stress response in A. palmata involving (1) growth arrest, (2) chaperone activity, (3) nucleic acid stabilization and repair, and (4) removal of damaged macromolecules. Other differentially expressed processes include sensory perception, metabolite transfer between host and endosymbiont, nitric oxide signaling, and modifications to the actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. The results are compared with those from a previous coral microarray study of thermal stress in Montastraea faveolata, and point to an overall evolutionary conserved bleaching response in scleractinian corals.",en

Elevated temperatures can result in the expulsion of Symbiodinium or loss of their photosynthetic pigments and is known as coral bleaching. It has been postulated that the expression of light-harvesting protein complexes (LHCs), which bind chlorophylls (chl) and carotenoids, are important in photobleaching. This study explored the effect a sixteen-day thermal stress (increasing daily from 25-34 °C) on integral LHC (chlorophyll a-chlorophyll c 2-peridinin protein complex (acpPC)) gene expression in Symbiodinium within the coral Acropora aspera. Thermal stress leads to a decrease in Symbiodinium photosynthetic efficiency by day eight, while symbiont density was significantly lower on day sixteen. Over this time period, the gene expression of five Symbiodinium acpPC genes was quantified. Three acpPC genes exhibited up-regulated expression when corals were exposed to temperatures above 31.5 °C (acpPCSym_1:1, day sixteen; acpPCSym_15, day twelve; and acpPCSym_18, day ten and day sixteen). In contrast, the expression of acpPCSym_5:1 and acpPCSym_10:1 was unchanged throughout the experiment. Interestingly, the three acpPC genes with increased expression cluster together in a phylogenetic analysis of light-harvesting complexes. Photosynthetic eukaryotic dinoflagellates belonging to the genus Symbiodinium form symbiotic relationships with a variety of marine taxa. Endosymbiotic associations observed between these photosynthetic dinoflagellates and corals are generally classed as mutualistic, as both the host and symbiont benefit from the relationship 1,2. The photosynthetic symbiont acquires nutrients such as inorganic carbon, nitrogen and phosphate from host cells 3 , in turn symbionts then provide up to 90% of the energy required by corals to grow and reproduce. These relationships between scleractinian corals and Symbiodinium are critical for the proliferation of reefs supporting diverse marine ecosystems. Coral bleaching, the loss of photosynthetic pigments or endosymbionts from host cells occurs under stress conditions such as elevated sea temperatures of only a few degrees above long-term maxima 4,5. While ocean temperature fluctuations occur on a daily basis, the mean sea surface temperature is predicted to rise by approximately 1-2 °C over the next century and is expected to lead to more mass bleaching events 6,7. Experimentation on Symbiodinium and the coral holobiont has focussed on many environmental factors implicated in the onset of coral bleaching including elevated seawater temperatures, eutrophication and disease. The effect of high sea-surface temperatures have been a key focus due to mass coral bleaching events (~42% GBR reefs bleached in 1998 and ~54% reefs bleached in 2002 8), attributed to global climate change 7 with the 1998 bleaching event coinciding with an El Niño Southern Oscillation event 4,9. Differential thermal stress sensitivity is observed across the diverse Symbiodinium species complex, with both heat tolerant and heat sensitive species observed within the same clade 10. Differences in photoinhibition sensitivity have either been acquired independently by thermally tolerant types or have been acquired in the common ancestor of all Symbiodinium types and since lost in thermally sensitive species 10. Elucidation of sites of thermal sensitivity within Symbiodinium has focussed on potential points where damage results in a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency 11,12. These potential points include damage to the D1 protein of photosystem II (PSII) 12 ,",en

Results: These experiments reveal similarities with the responses both of arthropods and mammals, as well as coral-specific effects. The most surprising finding was that MDP specifically induced three members of the GiMAP gene family, which has been implicated in immunity in mammals but is absent from Drosophila and Caenorhabditis. Like their mammalian homologs, GiMAP genes are arranged in a tandem cluster in the coral genome. Conclusions: A phylogenomic survey of this gene family implies ancient origins, multiple independent losses and lineage-specific expansions during animal evolution. Whilst functional convergence cannot be ruled out, GiMAP expression in corals may reflect an ancestral role in immunity, perhaps in phagolysosomal processing.",en

The 35 kDa heat-shock protein was further demonstrated to be heme oxygenase by immunoblotting, suggesting the involvement of oxidative stress in coral cells during heat treatment. Since the expression of hsps needs the activation of a calcium signal, the change of intracellular calcium concentration in coral cells was examined by a FURA 2 fluorescence method under heat treatment. Intracellular calcium concentration increased at high temperatures with or without the presence of ambient calcium. The extent of the calcium concentration increase was constant for at least 6 hours.

Using cDNA microarrays, we compared expression levels of 2051 genes from early embryos and larvae at multiple developmental stages (including pre-blastula, blastula, gastrula, and planula stages) at each of the three temperatures. At 12 h post-fertilization in 28°C treatments, genes involved in cell replication/cell division and transcription were up-regulated in A. palmata embryos, followed by a reduction in expression of these genes during later growth stages. From 24.5 to 131 h post-fertilization at 28°C, A. palmata altered its transcriptome by up-regulating genes involved in protein synthesis and metabolism. Temperatures of 30°C and 31.5°C caused major changes to the A. palmata embryonic transcriptomes, particularly in the samples from 24.5 hpf post-fertilization, characterized by downregulation of numerous genes involved in cell replication/cell division, metabolism, cytoskeleton, and transcription, while heat shock genes were up-regulated compared to 28°C treatments.

We investigated the coral communities in two sites, an exposed and a protected site, at Iriomote Island, Japan, from 2005 to 2008. During the study period, a cyclone and thermal stress were observed. All Acropora colonies, classified into four morphologies (arborescent, tabular, corymbose, and digitate), were identified and tracked through time to calculate the annual mortality and growth rate. The mortality of all Acropora colonies in the protected site was lower than that in the exposed site during the period without disturbances. Extremely higher mortality due to bleaching was observed in tabular and corymbose Acropora, compared to other growth forms, at the protected sites after thermal stress. In contrast, physical disturbance by a tropical cyclone induced the highest mortality in arborescent and digitate corals at the exposed site. Moreover, arborescent corals exhibited a remarkable decline 1 year after the tropical cyclone at the exposed site. The growth of colonies that survived coral bleaching did not decrease in the following year compared to previous year for all growth forms, but the growth of arborescent and tabular remnant corals at the exposed site declined severely after the tropical cyclone compared to previous year. The delayed mortality and lowered growth rate after the tropical cyclone were probably due to the damage caused by the tropical cyclone. These results indicate that the cyclone had a greater impact on fragile corals than expected.

Global gene expression profiling is a powerful hypothesis-forming tool that can help elucidate these traits. Here, we applied a novel RNA-Seq protocol to study molecular responses to heat and settlement inducers in aposymbiotic larvae of the reef-building coral Acropora millepora. This analysis of a single full-sibling family revealed contrasting responses between short-(4-h) and longterm (5-day) exposures to elevated temperatures. Heat shock proteins were up-regulated only in the short-term treatment, while the long-term treatment induced the downregulation of ribosomal proteins and up-regulation of genes associated with ion transport and metabolism (Ca 2+ and CO 3 2)). We also profiled responses to settlement cues using a natural cue (crustose coralline algae, CCA) and a synthetic neuropeptide (GLW-amide). Both cues resulted in metamorphosis, accompanied by differential expression of genes with known developmental roles. Some genes were regulated only by the natural cue, which may correspond to the recruitment-associated behaviour and morphology changes that precede metamorphosis under CCA treatment, but are bypassed under GLW-amide treatment. Validation of these expression profiles using qPCR confirmed the quantitative accuracy of our RNA-Seq approach. Importantly, qPCR analysis of different larval families revealed extensive variation in these responses depending on genetic background, including qualitative differences (i.e. up-regulation in one family and downregulation in another). Future studies of gene expression in corals will have to address this genetic variation, which could have important adaptive consequences for corals during global climate change.",en

Surveying the coral genome revealed not only a larger number of NACHT-and related domain nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, R proteins, and CED-4 (NB-ARC)-encoding loci ($500) than in other metazoans but also surprising diversity of domain combinations among the coral NACHT/NB-ARC-containing proteins; N-terminal effector domains included the apoptosis-related domains caspase recruitment domain (CARD), death effector domain (DED), and Death, and C-terminal repeat domains included LRRs, tetratricopeptide repeats, ankyrin repeats, and WD40 repeats. Many of the predicted coral proteins that contain a NACHT/NB-ARC domain also contain a glycosyl transferase group 1 domain, a novel domain combination first found in metazoans. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the NACHT/NB-ARC domain inventories of various metazoan lineages, including corals, are largely products of lineage-specific expansions. Many of the NACHT/NB-ARC loci are organized in pairs or triplets in the Acropora genome, suggesting that the large coral NACHT/NB-ARC repertoire has been generated at least in part by tandem duplication. In addition, shuffling of N-terminal effector domains may have occurred after expansions of specific NACHT/ NB-ARC-repeat domain types. These results illustrate the extraordinary complexity of the innate immune repertoire of corals, which may in part reflect adaptive evolution to a symbiotic lifestyle in a uniquely complex and challenging environment.",en

In particular, molecular and cellular mechanisms enabling the establishment and maintenance of obligate endosymbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates require further clarification. By extension, such understanding may also shed light upon environmental conditions that promote the collapse of this mutualism. Genomic data undergird studies of all symbiotic processes. Here we review recent genomic data derived from the scleractinian coral, Acropora digitifera, and the endosymbiotic dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium minutum. We discuss Acropora genes involved in calcification, embryonic development, innate immunity, apoptosis, autophagy, UV resistance, fluorescence, photoreceptors, circadian clocks, etc. We also detail gene loss in amino acid metabolism that may explain at least part of the Acropora stress-response. Characteristic features of the Symbiodinium genome are also reviewed, focusing on the expansion of certain gene families, the molecular basis for permanently condensed chromatin, unique spliceosomal splicing, and unusual gene arrangement. Salient features of the Symbiodinium plastid and mitochondrial genomes are also illuminated. Although many questions regarding these interdependent genomes remain, we summarize information necessary for future studies of coral-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis.",en

The amino acid sequence of A. tenuis HSP90 showed a high degree of similarity with the hermatypic-coral HSP90 families. After a 7-d exposure to 1 or 10 μg/L of Irgarol, the body colours of corals in the 10 μg/L treatment group were significantly whiter (bleached), whereas no such effects were observed in the corals in the 1 μg/L treatment group. However, the expression level of coral HSP90 was significantly downregulated after exposure to both 1 and 10 μg/L Irgarol. These results suggest that A. tenuis HSP90 may be a useful molecular biomarker to predict bleaching caused by herbicides.",en

Thus, analyses of the bleaching mechanism and important genes involved in coral responses to thermal stress and bleaching are important. This study explored the gene expression profiling data (GSE16151) from the Gene Expression Omnibus database by using bioinformatics analysis to study the molecular processes and hub genes involved in the thermal stress and bleaching responses of the coral Acropora palmata. The results suggest that thermal stress down-regulated the snoRNP genes, which led to a reduction of some ribosomal proteins, and then decreased biosynthesis, resulting in disruption of a series of biological processes such as the glyoxylate cycle and vitamin metabolic processes. Moreover, the coral cytoskeleton showed breakdown because the CCT7 gene was down-regulated and because of insufficient adenosine triphosphate production caused by the thermal stress. All these responses will destroy the P53 pathway and initiate apoptosis and ultimately necrosis. In addition, 107 differentially expressed genes were detected between the normal and bleached corals, indicating that snoRNPs, CCT7, RPL37, and RPS27A may be the hub genes responsible for thermal stress and bleaching responses. These genes can be used as new biomarkers to help solve the problem of coral bleaching.",en
10.1086_bblv216n2p131,NA,Transcriptome Analysis of the Circadian Regulatory Network in the Coral Acropora millepora,NA,NA,"Entrained circadian rhythms control many biological processes. These cyclical systems are synchronized by environmental signals but continue to free run for a considerable time when the synchronizing stimuli are removed. In scleractinian corals that reproduce by broadcast spawning, timing processes are essential in ensuring successful fertilization. It is not known whether spawn timing is regulated directly by environmental signals or if it is entrained and regulated by circadian or circalunar rhythms. The genetic components of circadian systems have been studied in considerable detail in microbes, plants, and animals. To identify potential participants in regulating scleractinian circadian systems, we have undertaken a bioinformatic analysis of the transcriptome of larvae of the coral Acropora millepora. Acropora contigs assembled from more than 600,000 sequencing reads from larval mRNA were searched via NCBI BLAST for matches to 24 key insect and mammalian circadian genes. Matches were found to all queried genes, with 22 of 24 of these matches having strong confidence levels. An Acropora match to the nonvisual photoreceptor melanopsin was also identified. The high level of conservation of circadian gene networks implies that the regulatory interactions between pathway members are also likely to be conserved and to regulate entrained processes in corals.",en

Understanding how elevated temperatures and nutrient concentration affect early transcriptional changes in corals and their algal endosymbionts is critically important for evaluating the responses of coral reefs to global changes happening in the environment. Here, we investigated the expression of genes in colonies of the reef-building coral Acropora aspera exposed to short-term sub-lethal levels of thermal (+6°C) and nutrient stress (ammonium-enrichment: 20 μM). Results: The RNA-Seq data provided hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) corresponding to various stress regimes, with 115 up-and 78 down-regulated genes common to all stress regimes. A list of DEGs included up-regulated coral genes like cytochrome c oxidase and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and up-regulated photosynthetic genes of algal origin, whereas coral GFP-like fluorescent chromoprotein and sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase showed reduced transcript levels. Taxonomic analyses of the coral holobiont disclosed the dominant presence of transcripts from coral (~70%) and Symbiodinium (~10-12%), as well as~15-20% of unknown sequences which lacked sequence identity to known genes. Gene ontology analyses revealed enriched pathways, which led to changes in the dynamics of protein networks affecting growth, cellular processes, and energy requirement.",en

We surveyed the recently decoded genome of the coral, Acropora digitifera, for photoreceptor and circadian genes, using molecular phylogenetic analyses. Our search for photoreceptor genes yielded seven opsin and three cryptochrome genes. Two genes from each family likely underwent tandem duplication in the coral lineage. We also found the following A. digitifera orthologs to Drosophila and mammalian circadian clock genes: four clock, one bmal/cycle, three pdp1-like, one creb/atf, one sgg/zw3, two ck2alpha, one dco (csnk1d/cnsk1e), one slim/BTRC, and one grinl. No vrille, rev-ervα/nr1d1, bhlh2, vpac2, adcyap1, or adcyaplr1 orthologs were found. Intriguingly, in spite of an extensive survey, we also failed to find homologs of period and timeless, although we did find one timeout gene. In addition, the coral genes were compared to orthologous genes in the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis. Thus, the coral and sea anemone genomes share a similar repertoire of circadian clock genes, although A. digitifera contains more clock genes and fewer photoreceptor genes than N. vectensis. This suggests that the circadian clock system was established in a common ancestor of corals and sea anemones, and was diversified by tandem gene duplications and the loss of paralogous genes in each lineage. It will be interesting to determine how the coral circadian clock functions without period.",en

In the present study, the stony coral Acropora aculeus was subjected to acute heat stress and entire transcriptomes were sequenced via the next generation sequencing platform. Four paired-end libraries were constructed and sequenced in two groups, including a control and a heat stress group. A total of 120,319,751 paired-end reads with lengths of 2 Â 100 bp were assembled and 55,021 coral-derived genes were obtained. After read mapping and abundance estimation, 9110 differentially expressed genes were obtained in the comparison between the control and heat stress group, including 4465 significantly upregulated and 4645 significantly downregulated genes. Twenty-three GO terms in the Biological Process category were overrepresented for significantly upregulated genes, and divided into six groups according to their relationship. These three groups were related to the NF-kB signal pathway, and the remaining three groups were relevant for pathogen response, immunocyte activation and protein ubiquitination. Forty-three common genes were found in four GO terms, which were directly related to the NF-kB signal pathway. These included 2 NACHT, LRR, PYD domainscontaining protein, 5 nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein, 29 NLRC3-like protein, 4 NLRC5-like protein, and 3 uncharacterized protein. For significantly downregulated genes, 27 overrepresented GO terms were found in the Biological Process category, which were relevant to protein ubiquitination and ATP metabolism. Our results indicate that heat stress suppressed the immune response level via the NLRC3-like protein, the fine-tuning of protein turnover activity, and ATP metabolism. This might disrupt the balance of coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis and result in the bleaching of the coral A. aculeus.",en

Here we compared gene expression profiles in eight healthy Acropora hyacinthus colonies against eight colonies exhibiting tissue loss commonly associated with white syndromes, all collected from a natural reef environment near Palau. Two types of tissues were sampled from diseased corals: visibly affected and apparently healthy. Results: Tag-based RNA-Seq followed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified groups of co-regulated differentially expressed genes between all health states (disease lesion, apparently healthy tissues of diseased colonies, and fully healthy). Differences between healthy and diseased tissues indicate activation of several innate immunity and tissue repair pathways accompanied by reduced calcification and the switch towards metabolic reliance on stored lipids. Unaffected parts of diseased colonies, although displaying a trend towards these changes, were not significantly different from fully healthy samples. Still, network analysis identified a group of genes, suggestive of altered immunity state, that were specifically up-regulated in unaffected parts of diseased colonies. Conclusions: Similarity of fully healthy samples to apparently healthy parts of diseased colonies indicates that systemic effects of white syndromes on A. hyacinthus are weak, which implies that the coral colony is largely able to sustain its physiological performance despite disease. The genes specifically up-regulated in unaffected parts of diseased colonies, instead of being the consequence of disease, might be related to the originally higher susceptibility of these colonies to naturally occurring white syndromes.",en

Variation in global gene expression (GE) and lipid and fatty acid (FA) composition of surviving colony fragments were quantified after four months. Major FA classes, with the exception of short-chain (C18) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), decreased in concentration when coral fragments were exposed to lower water quality regardless of their source population. In contrast, a strong effect of source population was detected in the GE profiles of all coral fragments and was enriched with genes associated with translation, ribosome biogenesis and ribosome cellular components. One cluster of co-expressed genes positively correlated with multiple individual FA and included genes involved in developmental processes and cellular pathways. This study demonstrates the strong influence of a source effect defining gene expression relating to basic biological functions, including biosynthetic processing, translation and ribosome biogenesis. However, there is plasticity in FA composition and specific genes relating to elevated health and immunity, which can respond to changes in environmental conditions. These findings suggest hope for future corals, if we can reduce anthropogenic water quality stressors.",en

Here, we describe expression profiles of Acropora muricata collected during opposing seasons in Otsuki, Kochi, Japan to define the capacity of corals to cope with changing environmental conditions. Coral communities in Otsuki experience large temperature fluctuations between the winter (~ 16 °C) and summer (~ 27 °C). Results: Coral nubbins that were collected in the summer showed no change in photochemical efficiency when exposed to thermal or cold stress, while winter samples showed a decrease in photochemical health when subjected to thermal stress. Under cold stress, corals that were collected in the summer showed an up-regulation of actin-related protein and serine/threonine protein kinase, while corals collected during the winter did not show any cellular stress. On the other hand, under thermal stress, the most notable change was the up-regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in corals that were collected during the winter season. Our observations in the differential genes expressed under temperature-derived stress suggest that A. muricata from Kochi may maintain physiological resilience due to the frequently encountered environmental stress, and this may play a role in the coral's thermal tolerance.",en

However, coral reefs are now undergoing massive and accelerating devastation due to bleaching. The fact that the breakdown of symbiosis between coral and the dinoflagellate, zooxanthellae, has been well elucidated as the main cause of bleaching, implying the establishment of symbiosis with zooxanthellae plays a crucial role in maintaining coral survival. However, the relevant molecular and cellular mechanisms have not been well studied yet. In this study, based on the deep RNA-sequencing data derived from Mohamed, A. R. et al., an integrated transcriptome analysis was performed to deeply investigate global transcriptome changes of the coral Acropora digitifera in response to infection by dinoflagellate of the genus Symbiodinium. Results: The results revealed that compared to RefTranscriptome_v1.0 (A. digitifera transcriptome assembly v1.0), numerous novel transcripts and isoforms were identified, the Symbiodinium-infected coral larvae at 4 h generated the highest proportion of specific isoforms. Alternative splicing analysis showed that intron retention predominated in all alternative transcripts among six statuses. Additionally, 8117 lncRNAs were predicted via a stringent stepwise filtering pipeline. A complex lncRNAs-mRNAs network including 815 lncRNAs and 6395 mRNAs were established, in which 21 lncRNAs were differentially expressed at 4 h post infection. Functional clustering analysis for those differentially lncRNAs-coexpressed mRNAs demonstrated that several biological processes and pathways related to protein kinase activity, metabolic pathways, mitochondrion, ribosome, etc. were enriched. Conclusions: Our study not only refined A. digitifera transcriptome via identification of novel transcripts and isoforms, but also predicted a high-confidence dataset of lncRNAs. Functional study based on the construction of lncRNAs-mRNAs co-expression network has disclosed a complex lncRNA-mediated regulation in response to Symbiodinium infection exhibited in A. digitifera. Once validated, these lncRNAs could be good potential targets for treatment and prevention of bleaching in coral.",en

Upon exposure to thermal stress, the intracellular formation of harmful oxygen intermediates can lead to the disruption of the obligate symbiosis between the coral host and their dinoflagellate endosymbionts (zooxanthellae), a process known as coral bleaching. Applications of molecular techniques to cnidarian research have recently enhanced our understanding of the magnitude of corals' transcriptional response to various stressors. In the present study, we developed a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay to assess expression levels of 4 genes involved in the corals' oxidative stress response (HSP70, MnSOD, ferritin, Zn 2+-metalloprotease) after exposure to laboratory-controlled thermal stress. Using the Indo-Pacific reef coral Acropora millepora, our study provides the first population-scale analysis of antioxidant gene expression in coral. Despite the significant up-regulation of those 4 genes in the thermally stressed samples relative to non-stressed samples, our results show that there is an enormous intraas well as inter-colony variation in transcript abundance at a particular point in time. We discuss the potential roles of ferritin and Zn 2+-metalloprotease in the break down of the intra-cellular Fe 2+homeostasis and in coral host cell detachment, respectively, during bleaching conditions.

Samples were collected from healthy and diseased corals and seawater around American Samoa and bacteria associated with AWS characterized using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, from coral mucus and tissue slurries, respectively. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone libraries derived from coral tissue were dominated by the Gammaproteobacteria, and Jaccard's distances calculated between the clone libraries showed that those from diseased corals were more similar to each other than to those from healthy corals. 16S rRNA genes from 78 culturable coral mucus isolates also revealed a distinct partitioning of bacterial genera into healthy and diseased corals. Isolates identified as Vibrionaceae were further characterized by multilocus sequence typing, revealing that whilst several Vibrio spp. were found to be associated with AWS lesions, a recently described species, Vibrio owensii, was prevalent amongst cultured Vibrio isolates. Unaffected tissues from corals with AWS had a different microbiota than normal Acropora as found by others. Determining whether a microbial shift occurs prior to disease outbreaks will be a useful avenue of pursuit and could be helpful in detecting prodromal signs of coral disease prior to manifestation of lesions.",en

On the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), low salinity events, which occur during summer seasons and can involve salinity dropping~10 PSU correlate with declines in coral cover, and these events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity under future climate change scenarios. In other marine invertebrates, exposure to low salinity causes increased expression of genes involved in proteolysis, responses to oxidative stress, and membrane transport, but the effects that changes in salinity have on corals have so far received only limited attention. To better understand the coral response to hypo-osmotic stress, here we investigated the transcriptomic response of the coral Acropora millepora in both adult and juvenile life stages to acute (1 h) and more prolonged (24 h) exposure to low salinity. Results: Differential gene expression analysis revealed the involvement of both common and specific response mechanisms in Acropora. The general response to environmental stressors included up-regulation of genes involved in the mitigation of macromolecular and oxidative damage, while up-regulation of genes involved in amino acid metabolism and transport represent specific responses to salinity stress.

Over the last 30 years, White Band Disease (WBD) alone has killed up to 95% of the Caribbean`s dominant shallow-water corals-the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis and the elkhorn coral A. palmata. Both corals are now listed on the US Endangered Species Act, and while their recovery has been slow, recent transmission surveys indicate that more than 5% of staghorn corals are disease resistant. Here we compared transcriptome-wide gene expression between resistant and susceptible staghorn corals exposed to WBD using in situ transmission assays. We identified constitutive gene expression differences underlying disease resistance that are independent from the immune response associated with disease exposure. Genes involved in RNA interference-mediated gene silencing, including Argonaute were up-regulated in resistant corals, whereas heat shock proteins (HSPs) were down-regulated. Up-regulation of Argonaute proteins indicates that post-transcriptional gene silencing plays a key, but previously unsuspected role in coral immunity and disease resistance. Constitutive expression of HSPs has been linked to thermal resilience in other Acropora corals, suggesting that the down-regulation of HSPs in disease resistant staghorn corals may confer a dual benefit of thermal resilience.",en
